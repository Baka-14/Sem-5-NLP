1997 Chairman's Letter



BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. 
1997 Chairman's Letter 




To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: 


������ Our gain in net worth during 1997
was $8.0 billion, which increased the per-share book value of both our
Class A and Class B stock by 34.1%. Over the last 33 years (that is, since
present management took over) per-share book value has grown from $19 to
$25,488, a rate of 24.1% compounded annually.(1)

                                  

      1.  All figures used in this report apply to Berkshire's A shares,
          the successor to the only stock that the company had outstanding
          before 1996.  The B shares have an economic interest equal to 1/30th
          that of the A.
                                  



������ Given our gain of 34.1%, it is
tempting to declare victory and move on. But last year's performance was
no great triumph: Any investor can chalk up large returns when stocks
soar, as they did in 1997. In a bull market, one must avoid the error of
the preening duck that quacks boastfully after a torrential rainstorm,
thinking that its paddling skills have caused it to rise in the world.
A right-thinking duck would instead compare its position after the downpour
to that of the other ducks on the pond. 
������ So what's our duck rating for 1997?
The table on the facing page shows that though we paddled furiously last
year, passive ducks that simply invested in the S&P Index rose almost
as fast as we did. Our appraisal of 1997's performance, then: Quack.

������ When the market booms, we tend
to suffer in comparison with the S&P Index. The Index bears no tax
costs, nor do mutual funds, since they pass through all tax liabilities
to their owners. Last year, on the other hand, Berkshire paid or accrued
$4.2 billion for federal income tax, or about 18% of our beginning net
worth. 
������ Berkshire will always have corporate
taxes to pay, which means it needs to overcome their drag in order to justify
its existence. Obviously, Charlie Munger, Berkshire's Vice Chairman and
my partner, and I won't be able to lick that handicap every year. But we
expect over time to maintain a modest advantage over the Index, and that
is the yardstick against which you should measure us. We will not ask you
to adopt the philosophy of the Chicago Cubs fan who reacted to a string
of lackluster seasons by saying, "Why get upset? Everyone has a bad
century now and then." 
������ Gains in book value are, of course,
not the bottom line at Berkshire. What truly counts are gains in per-share
intrinsic business value. Ordinarily, though, the two measures tend to
move roughly in tandem, and in 1997 that was the case: Led by a blow-out
performance at GEICO, Berkshire's intrinsic value (which far exceeds book
value) grew at nearly the same pace as book value. 
������ For more explanation of the term,
intrinsic value, you may wish to refer to our Owner's Manual, reprinted
on pages 62 to 71. This manual sets forth our owner-related business principles,
information that is important to all of Berkshire's shareholders. 
������ In our last two annual reports,
we furnished you a table that Charlie and I believe is central to estimating
Berkshire's intrinsic value. In the updated version of that table, which
follows, we trace our two key components of value. The first column lists
our per-share ownership of investments (including cash and equivalents)
and the second column shows our per-share earnings from Berkshire's operating
businesses before taxes and purchase-accounting adjustments (discussed
on pages 69 and 70), but after all interest and corporate expenses. The
second column excludes all dividends, interest and capital gains that we
realized from the investments presented in the first column. In effect,
the columns show what Berkshire would look like were it split into two
parts, with one entity holding our investments and the other operating
all of our businesses and bearing all corporate costs. 
                                           Pre-tax Earnings Per Share
                      Investments          Excluding All Income from
       Year             Per Share                   Investments        

       1967             $    41                      $  1.09
       1977                 372                        12.44    
       1987               3,910                       108.14    
       1997              38,043                       717.82    




������ Pundits who ignore what our 38,000
employees contribute to the company, and instead simply view Berkshire
as a de facto investment company, should study the figures in the second
column. We made our first business acquisition in 1967, and since then
our pre-tax operating earnings have grown from $1 million to $888 million.
Furthermore, as noted, in this exercise we have assigned all of Berkshire's
corporate expenses -- overhead of $6.6 million, interest of $66.9 million
and shareholder contributions of $15.4 million -- to our business operations,
even though a portion of these could just as well have been assigned to
the investment side. 
������ Here are the growth rates of the
two segments by decade: 
                                               Pre-tax Earnings Per Share
                          Investments          Excluding All Income from
  Decade Ending            Per Share                  Investments        

      1977                   24.6%                       27.6%
      1987                   26.5%                       24.1%
      1997                   25.5%                       20.8%
 Annual Growth
  Rate, 1967-1997            25.6%                       24.2%




������ During 1997, both parts of our
business grew at a satisfactory rate, with investments increasing by $9,543
per share, or 33.5%, and operating earnings growing by $296.43 per share,
or 70.3%. One important caveat: Because we were lucky in our super-cat
insurance business (to be discussed later) and because GEICO's underwriting
gain was well above what we can expect in most years, our 1997 operating
earnings were much better than we anticipated and also more than we expect
for 1998. 
������ Our rate of progress in both investments
and operations is certain to fall in the future. For anyone deploying
capital, nothing recedes like success. My own history makes the point:
Back in 1951, when I was attending Ben Graham's class at Columbia, an idea
giving me a $10,000 gain improved my investment performance for the year
by a full 100 percentage points. Today, an idea producing a $500 million
pre-tax profit for Berkshire adds one percentage point to our performance.
It's no wonder that my annual results in the 1950s were better by nearly
thirty percentage points than my annual gains in any subsequent decade.
Charlie's experience was similar. We weren't smarter then, just smaller.
At our present size, any performance superiority we achieve will be minor.

������ We will be helped, however, by
the fact that the businesses to which we have already allocated capital
-- both operating subsidiaries and companies in which we are passive investors
-- have splendid long-term prospects. We are also blessed with a managerial
corps that is unsurpassed in ability and focus. Most of these executives
are wealthy and do not need the pay they receive from Berkshire to maintain
their way of life. They are motivated by the joy of accomplishment, not
by fame or fortune. 
������ Though we are delighted with what
we own, we are not pleased with our prospects for committing incoming funds.
Prices are high for both businesses and stocks. That does not mean that
the prices of either will fall -- we have absolutely no view on that matter
-- but it does mean that we get relatively little in prospective earnings
when we commit fresh money. 


������ Under these circumstances, we try
to exert a Ted Williams kind of discipline. In his book The Science
of Hitting, Ted explains that he carved the strike zone into 77 cells,
each the size of a baseball. Swinging only at balls in his "best"
cell, he knew, would allow him to bat .400; reaching for balls in his "worst"
spot, the low outside corner of the strike zone, would reduce him to .230.
In other words, waiting for the fat pitch would mean a trip to the Hall
of Fame; swinging indiscriminately would mean a ticket to the minors. 
������ If they are in the strike zone
at all, the business "pitches" we now see are just catching the
lower outside corner. If we swing, we will be locked into low returns.
But if we let all of today's balls go by, there can be no assurance that
the next ones we see will be more to our liking. Perhaps the attractive
prices of the past were the aberrations, not the full prices of today.
Unlike Ted, we can't be called out if we resist three pitches that are
barely in the strike zone; nevertheless, just standing there, day after
day, with my bat on my shoulder is not my idea of fun. 


Unconventional Commitments 


������ When we can't find our favorite
commitment -- a well-run and sensibly-priced business with fine economics
-- we usually opt to put new money into very short-term instruments of
the highest quality. Sometimes, however, we venture elsewhere. Obviously
we believe that the alternative commitments we make are more likely to
result in profit than loss. But we also realize that they do not offer
the certainty of profit that exists in a wonderful business secured at
an attractive price. Finding that kind of opportunity, we know that
we are going to make money -- the only question being when. With alternative
investments, we think that we are going to make money. But we also
recognize that we will sometimes realize losses, occasionally of substantial
size. 
������ We had three non-traditional positions
at yearend. The first was derivative contracts for 14.0 million barrels
of oil, that being what was then left of a 45.7 million barrel position
we established in 1994-95. Contracts for 31.7 million barrels were settled
in 1995-97, and these supplied us with a pre-tax gain of about $61.9 million.
Our remaining contracts expire during 1998 and 1999. In these, we had an
unrealized gain of $11.6 million at yearend. Accounting rules require that
commodity positions be carried at market value. Therefore, both our annual
and quarterly financial statements reflect any unrealized gain or loss
in these contracts. When we established our contracts, oil for future delivery
seemed modestly underpriced. Today, though, we have no opinion as to its
attractiveness. 
������ Our second non-traditional commitment
is in silver. Last year, we purchased 111.2 million ounces. Marked to market,
that position produced a pre-tax gain of $97.4 million for us in 1997.
In a way, this is a return to the past for me: Thirty years ago, I bought
silver because I anticipated its demonetization by the U.S. Government.
Ever since, I have followed the metal's fundamentals but not owned it.
In recent years, bullion inventories have fallen materially, and last summer
Charlie and I concluded that a higher price would be needed to establish
equilibrium between supply and demand. Inflation expectations, it should
be noted, play no part in our calculation of silver's value. 
������ Finally, our largest non-traditional
position at yearend was $4.6 billion, at amortized cost, of long-term zero-coupon
obligations of the U.S. Treasury. These securities pay no interest. Instead,
they provide their holders a return by way of the discount at which they
are purchased, a characteristic that makes their market prices move rapidly
when interest rates change. If rates rise, you lose heavily with zeros,
and if rates fall, you make outsized gains. Since rates fell in 1997, we
ended the year with an unrealized pre-tax gain of $598.8 million in our
zeros. Because we carry the securities at market value, that gain is reflected
in yearend book value. 
������ In purchasing zeros, rather than
staying with cash-equivalents, we risk looking very foolish: A macro-based
commitment such as this never has anything close to a 100% probability
of being successful. However, you pay Charlie and me to use our best judgment
-- not to avoid embarrassment -- and we will occasionally make an unconventional
move when we believe the odds favor it. Try to think kindly of us when
we blow one. Along with President Clinton, we will be feeling your pain:
The Munger family has more than 90% of its net worth in Berkshire and the
Buffetts more than 99%. 


How We Think About Market Fluctuations 


������ A short quiz: If you plan to eat
hamburgers throughout your life and are not a cattle producer, should you
wish for higher or lower prices for beef? Likewise, if you are going to
buy a car from time to time but are not an auto manufacturer, should you
prefer higher or lower car prices? These questions, of course, answer themselves.

������ But now for the final exam: If
you expect to be a net saver during the next five years, should you hope
for a higher or lower stock market during that period? Many investors get
this one wrong. Even though they are going to be net buyers of stocks for
many years to come, they are elated when stock prices rise and depressed
when they fall. In effect, they rejoice because prices have risen for the
"hamburgers" they will soon be buying. This reaction makes no
sense. Only those who will be sellers of equities in the near future should
be happy at seeing stocks rise. Prospective purchasers should much prefer
sinking prices. 
������ For shareholders of Berkshire who
do not expect to sell, the choice is even clearer. To begin with, our owners
are automatically saving even if they spend every dime they personally
earn: Berkshire "saves" for them by retaining all earnings, thereafter
using these savings to purchase businesses and securities. Clearly, the
more cheaply we make these buys, the more profitable our owners' indirect
savings program will be. 
������ Furthermore, through Berkshire
you own major positions in companies that consistently repurchase their
shares. The benefits that these programs supply us grow as prices fall:
When stock prices are low, the funds that an investee spends on repurchases
increase our ownership of that company by a greater amount than is the
case when prices are higher. For example, the repurchases that Coca-Cola,
The Washington Post and Wells Fargo made in past years at very low prices
benefitted Berkshire far more than do today's repurchases, made at loftier
prices. 
������ At the end of every year, about
97% of Berkshire's shares are held by the same investors who owned them
at the start of the year. That makes them savers. They should therefore
rejoice when markets decline and allow both us and our investees to deploy
funds more advantageously. 
������ So smile when you read a headline
that says "Investors lose as market falls." Edit it in your mind
to "Disinvestors lose as market falls -- but investors gain."
Though writers often forget this truism, there is a buyer for every seller
and what hurts one necessarily helps the other. (As they say in golf matches:
"Every putt makes someone happy.") 
������ We gained enormously from the low
prices placed on many equities and businesses in the 1970s and 1980s. Markets
that then were hostile to investment transients were friendly to those
taking up permanent residence. In recent years, the actions we took in
those decades have been validated, but we have found few new opportunities.
In its role as a corporate "saver," Berkshire continually looks
for ways to sensibly deploy capital, but it may be some time before we
find opportunities that get us truly excited. 


Insurance Operations -- Overview 


������ What does excite us, however, is
our insurance business. GEICO is flying, and we expect that it will continue
to do so. Before we expound on that, though, let's discuss "float"
and how to measure its cost. Unless you understand this subject, it will
be impossible for you to make an informed judgment about Berkshire's intrinsic
value. 
������ To begin with, float is money we
hold but don't own. In an insurance operation, float arises because premiums
are received before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes extends
over many years. During that time, the insurer invests the money. Typically,
this pleasant activity carries with it a downside: The premiums that an
insurer takes in usually do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually
must pay. That leaves it running an "underwriting loss," which
is the cost of float. An insurance business has value if its cost of float
over time is less than the cost the company would otherwise incur to obtain
funds. But the business is a lemon if its cost of float is higher than
market rates for money. 


������ A caution is appropriate here:
Because loss costs must be estimated, insurers have enormous latitude in
figuring their underwriting results, and that makes it very difficult for
investors to calculate a company's true cost of float. Estimating errors,
usually innocent but sometimes not, can be huge. The consequences of these
miscalculations flow directly into earnings. An experienced observer can
usually detect large-scale errors in reserving, but the general public
can typically do no more than accept what's presented, and at times I have
been amazed by the numbers that big-name auditors have implicitly blessed.
As for Berkshire, Charlie and I attempt to be conservative in presenting
its underwriting results to you, because we have found that virtually all
surprises in insurance are unpleasant ones. 
������ As the numbers in the following
table show, Berkshire's insurance business has been a huge winner. For
the table, we have calculated our float -- which we generate in large amounts
relative to our premium volume -- by adding net loss reserves, loss adjustment
reserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned premium reserves,
and then subtracting agents' balances, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid
taxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance. Our cost
of float is determined by our underwriting loss or profit. In those years
when we have had an underwriting profit, such as the last five, our cost
of float has been negative. In effect, we have been paid for holding money.

������ Since 1967, when we entered the
insurance business, our float has grown at an annual compounded rate of
21.7%. Better yet, it has cost us nothing, and in fact has made us money.
Therein lies an accounting irony: Though our float is shown on our balance
sheet as a liability, it has had a value to Berkshire greater than an equal
amount of net worth would have had. 
������ The expiration of several large
contracts will cause our float to decline during the first quarter of 1998,
but we expect it to grow substantially over the long term. We also believe
that our cost of float will continue to be highly favorable. 


Super-Cat Insurance 


������ Occasionally, however, the cost
of our float will spike severely. That will occur because of our heavy
involvement in the super-cat business, which by its nature is the most
volatile of all insurance lines. In this operation, we sell policies that
insurance and reinsurance companies purchase in order to limit their losses
when mega-catastrophes strike. Berkshire is the preferred market for sophisticated
buyers: When the "big one" hits, the financial strength of super-cat
writers will be tested, and Berkshire has no peer in this respect. 
������ Since truly major catastrophes
are rare occurrences, our super-cat business can be expected to show large
profits in most years -- and to record a huge loss occasionally. In other
words, the attractiveness of our super-cat business will take a great many
years to measure. What you must understand, however, is that a truly
terrible year in the super-cat business is not a possibility -- it's a
certainty. The only question is when it will come. 
������ Last year, we were very lucky in
our super-cat operation. The world suffered no catastrophes that caused
huge amounts of insured damage, so virtually all premiums that we received
dropped to the bottom line. This pleasant result has a dark side, however.
Many investors who are "innocents" -- meaning that they rely
on representations of salespeople rather than on underwriting knowledge
of their own -- have come into the reinsurance business by means of purchasing
pieces of paper that are called "catastrophe bonds." The second
word in this term, though, is an Orwellian misnomer: A true bond obliges
the issuer to pay; these bonds, in effect, are contracts that lay a provisional
promise to pay on the purchaser. 
������ This convoluted arrangement came
into being because the promoters of the contracts wished to circumvent
laws that prohibit the writing of insurance by entities that haven't been
licensed by the state. A side benefit for the promoters is that calling
the insurance contract a "bond" may also cause unsophisticated
buyers to assume that these instruments involve far less risk than is actually
the case. 
������ Truly outsized risks will exist
in these contracts if they are not properly priced. A pernicious aspect
of catastrophe insurance, however, makes it likely that mispricing, even
of a severe variety, will not be discovered for a very long time. Consider,
for example, the odds of throwing a 12 with a pair of dice -- 1 out of
36. Now assume that the dice will be thrown once a year; that you, the
"bond-buyer," agree to pay $50 million if a 12 appears; and that
for "insuring" this risk you take in an annual "premium"
of $1 million. That would mean you had significantly underpriced the risk.
Nevertheless, you could go along for years thinking you were making money
-- indeed, easy money. There is actually a 75.4% probability that you would
go for a decade without paying out a dime. Eventually, however, you would
go broke. 
������ In this dice example, the odds
are easy to figure. Calculations involving monster hurricanes and earthquakes
are necessarily much fuzzier, and the best we can do at Berkshire is to
estimate a range of probabilities for such events. The lack of precise
data, coupled with the rarity of such catastrophes, plays into the hands
of promoters, who typically employ an "expert" to advise the
potential bond-buyer about the probability of losses. The expert puts no
money on the table. Instead, he receives an up-front payment that is forever
his no matter how inaccurate his predictions. Surprise: When the stakes
are high, an expert can invariably be found who will affirm -- to return
to our example -- that the chance of rolling a 12 is not 1 in 36, but more
like 1 in 100. (In fairness, we should add that the expert will probably
believe that his odds are correct, a fact that makes him less reprehensible
-- but more dangerous.) 
������ The influx of "investor"
money into catastrophe bonds -- which may well live up to their name --
has caused super-cat prices to deteriorate materially. Therefore, we will
write less business in 1998. We have some large multi-year contracts in
force, however, that will mitigate the drop. The largest of these are two
policies that we described in last year's report -- one covering hurricanes
in Florida and the other, signed with the California Earthquake Authority,
covering earthquakes in that state. Our "worst-case" loss remains
about $600 million after-tax, the maximum we could lose under the CEA policy.
Though this loss potential may sound large, it is only about 1% of Berkshire's
market value. Indeed, if we could get appropriate prices, we would be willing
to significantly increase our "worst-case" exposure. 
������ Our super-cat business was developed
from scratch by Ajit Jain, who has contributed to Berkshire's success in
a variety of other ways as well. Ajit possesses both the discipline to
walk away from business that is inadequately priced and the imagination
to then find other opportunities. Quite simply, he is one of Berkshire's
major assets. Ajit would have been a star in whatever career he chose;
fortunately for us, he enjoys insurance. 


Insurance -- GEICO (1-800-555-2756) and Other Primary Operations



������ Last year I wrote about GEICO's
Tony Nicely and his terrific management skills. If I had known then what
he had in store for us in 1997, I would have searched for still greater
superlatives. Tony, now 54, has been with GEICO for 36 years and last year
was his best. As CEO, he has transmitted vision, energy and enthusiasm
to all members of the GEICO family -- raising their sights from what has
been achieved to what can be achieved. 
������ We measure GEICO's performance
by first, the net increase in its voluntary auto policies (that is, not
including policies assigned us by the state) and, second, the profitability
of "seasoned" auto business, meaning policies that have been
with us for more than a year and are thus past the period in which acquisition
costs cause them to be money-losers. In 1996, in-force business grew 10%,
and I told you how pleased I was, since that rate was well above anything
we had seen in two decades. Then, in 1997, growth jumped to 16%. 
������ Below are the new business and
in-force figures for the last five years: 


                      New Voluntary      Voluntary Auto
      Years           Auto Policies    Policies in Force

       1993              354,882           2,011,055    
       1994              396,217           2,147,549
       1995              461,608           2,310,037
       1996              617,669           2,543,699
       1997              913,176           2,949,439

������ Of course, any insurer can grow
rapidly if it gets careless about underwriting. GEICO's underwriting profit
for the year, though, was 8.1% of premiums, far above its average. Indeed,
that percentage was higher than we wish it to be: Our goal is to pass on
most of the benefits of our low-cost operation to our customers, holding
ourselves to about 4% in underwriting profit. With that in mind, we reduced
our average rates a bit during 1997 and may well cut them again this year.
Our rate changes varied, of course, depending on the policyholder and where
he lives; we strive to charge a rate that properly reflects the loss expectancy
of each driver. 
������ GEICO is not the only auto insurer
obtaining favorable results these days. Last year, the industry recorded
profits that were far better than it anticipated or can sustain. Intensified
competition will soon squeeze margins very significantly. But this is a
development we welcome: Long term, a tough market helps the low-cost operator,
which is what we are and intend to remain. 
������ Last year I told you about the
record 16.9% profit-sharing contribution that GEICO's associates had earned
and explained that two simple variables set the amount: policy growth and
profitability of seasoned business. I further explained that 1996's performance
was so extraordinary that we had to enlarge the chart delineating the possible
payouts. The new configuration didn't make it through 1997: We enlarged
the chart's boundaries again and awarded our 10,500 associates a profit-sharing
contribution amounting to 26.9% of their base compensation, or $71 million.
In addition, the same two variables -- policy growth and profitability
of seasoned business -- determined the cash bonuses that we paid to dozens
of top executives, starting with Tony. 


������ At GEICO, we are paying in a way
that makes sense for both our owners and our managers. We distribute merit
badges, not lottery tickets: In none of Berkshire's subsidiaries do we
relate compensation to our stock price, which our associates cannot affect
in any meaningful way. Instead, we tie bonuses to each unit's business
performance, which is the direct product of the unit's people. When that
performance is terrific -- as it has been at GEICO -- there is nothing
Charlie and I enjoy more than writing a big check. 
������ GEICO's underwriting profitability
will probably fall in 1998, but the company's growth could accelerate.
We're planning to step on the gas: GEICO's marketing expenditures this
year will top $100 million, up 50% from 1997. Our market share today is
only 3%, a level of penetration that should increase dramatically in the
next decade. The auto insurance industry is huge -- it does about $115
billion of volume annually -- and there are tens of millions of drivers
who would save substantial money by switching to us. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
������ In the 1995 report, I described
the enormous debt that you and I owe to Lorimer Davidson. On a Saturday
early in 1951, he patiently explained the ins and outs of both GEICO and
its industry to me -- a 20-year-old stranger who'd arrived at GEICO's headquarters
uninvited and unannounced. Davy later became the company's CEO and has
remained my friend and teacher for 47 years. The huge rewards that GEICO
has heaped on Berkshire would not have materialized had it not been for
his generosity and wisdom. Indeed, had I not met Davy, I might never have
grown to understand the whole field of insurance, which over the years
has played such a key part in Berkshire's success. 
������ Davy turned 95 last year, and it's
difficult for him to travel. Nevertheless, Tony and I hope that we can
persuade him to attend our annual meeting, so that our shareholders can
properly thank him for his important contributions to Berkshire. Wish us
luck. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
������ Though they are, of course, far
smaller than GEICO, our other primary insurance operations turned in results
last year that, in aggregate, were fully as stunning. National Indemnity's
traditional business had an underwriting profit of 32.9% and, as usual,
developed a large amount of float compared to premium volume. Over the
last three years, this segment of our business, run by Don Wurster, has
had a profit of 24.3%. Our homestate operation, managed by Rod Eldred,
recorded an underwriting profit of 14.1% even though it continued to absorb
the expenses of geographical expansion. Rod's three-year record is an amazing
15.1%. Berkshire's workers' compensation business, run out of California
by Brad Kinstler, had a modest underwriting loss in a difficult environment;
its three-year underwriting record is a positive 1.5%. John Kizer, at Central
States Indemnity, set a new volume record while generating good underwriting
earnings. At Kansas Bankers Surety, Don Towle more than lived up to the
high expectations we had when we purchased the company in 1996. 
������ In aggregate, these five operations
recorded an underwriting profit of 15.0%. The two Dons, along with Rod,
Brad and John, have created significant value for Berkshire, and we believe
there is more to come. 


Sources of Reported Earnings 


������ The table that follows shows the
main sources of Berkshire's reported earnings. In this presentation, purchase-accounting
adjustments are not assigned to the specific businesses to which they apply,
but are instead aggregated and shown separately. This procedure lets you
view the earnings of our businesses as they would have been reported had
we not purchased them. For the reasons discussed on pages 69 and 70, this
form of presentation seems to us to be more useful to investors and managers
than one utilizing generally-accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which
require purchase-premiums to be charged off business-by-business. The total
earnings we show in the table are, of course, identical to the GAAP total
in our audited financial statements.

������ Overall, our operating businesses
continue to perform exceptionally well, far outdoing their industry norms.
We are particularly pleased that profits improved at Helzberg's after a
disappointing 1996. Jeff Comment, Helzberg's CEO, took decisive steps early
in 1997 that enabled the company to gain real momentum by the crucial Christmas
season. In the early part of this year, as well, sales remained strong.

������ Casual observers may not appreciate
just how extraordinary the performance of many of our businesses has been:
If the earnings history of, say, Buffalo News or Scott Fetzer is compared
to the records of their publicly-owned peers, their performance might seem
to have been unexceptional. But most public companies retain two-thirds
or more of their earnings to fund their corporate growth. In contrast,
those Berkshire subsidiaries have paid 100% of their earnings to us, their
parent company, to fund our growth. 
������ In effect, the records of the public
companies reflect the cumulative benefits of the earnings they have retained,
while the records of our operating subsidiaries get no such boost. Over
time, however, the earnings these subsidiaries have distributed have created
truly huge amounts of earning power elsewhere in Berkshire. The News, See's
and Scott Fetzer have alone paid us $1.8 billion, which we have gainfully
employed elsewhere. We owe their managements our gratitude for much more
than the earnings that are detailed in the table. 


������ Additional information about our
various businesses is given on pages 36 - 50, where you will also find
our segment earnings reported on a GAAP basis. In addition, on pages 55
- 61, we have rearranged Berkshire's financial data into four segments
on a non-GAAP basis, a presentation that corresponds to the way Charlie
and I think about the company. Our intent is to supply you with the financial
information that we would wish you to give us if our positions were reversed.



Look-Through Earnings 


������ Reported earnings are a poor measure
of economic progress at Berkshire, in part because the numbers shown in
the table presented earlier include only the dividends we receive from
investees -- though these dividends typically represent only a small fraction
of the earnings attributable to our ownership. Not that we mind this division
of money, since on balance we regard the undistributed earnings of investees
as more valuable to us than the portion paid out. The reason is simple:
Our investees often have the opportunity to reinvest earnings at high rates
of return. So why should we want them paid out? 
������ To depict something closer to economic
reality at Berkshire than reported earnings, though, we employ the concept
of "look-through" earnings. As we calculate these, they consist
of: (1) the operating earnings reported in the previous section, plus;
(2) our share of the retained operating earnings of major investees that,
under GAAP accounting, are not reflected in our profits, less; (3) an allowance
for the tax that would be paid by Berkshire if these retained earnings
of investees had instead been distributed to us. When tabulating "operating
earnings" here, we exclude purchase-accounting adjustments as well
as capital gains and other major non-recurring items. 
������ The following table sets forth
our 1997 look-through earnings, though I warn you that the figures can
be no more than approximate, since they are based on a number of judgment
calls. (The dividends paid to us by these investees have been included
in the operating earnings itemized on page 11, mostly under "Insurance
Group: Net Investment Income.")

Acquisitions of 1997 


������ In 1997, we agreed to acquire Star
Furniture and International Dairy Queen (a deal that closed early in 1998).
Both businesses fully meet our criteria: They are understandable; possess
excellent economics; and are run by outstanding people. 
������ The Star transaction has an interesting
history. Whenever we buy into an industry whose leading participants aren't
known to me, I always ask our new partners, "Are there any more at
home like you?" Upon our purchase of Nebraska Furniture Mart in 1983,
therefore, the Blumkin family told me about three outstanding furniture
retailers in other parts of the country. At the time, however, none was
for sale. 
������ Many years later, Irv Blumkin learned
that Bill Child, CEO of R.C. Willey -- one of the recommended three --
might be interested in merging, and we promptly made the deal described
in the 1995 report. We have been delighted with that association -- Bill
is the perfect partner. Furthermore, when we asked Bill about industry
standouts, he came up with the remaining two names given me by the Blumkins,
one of these being Star Furniture of Houston. But time went by without
there being any indication that either of the two was available. 
������ On the Thursday before last year's
annual meeting, however, Bob Denham of Salomon told me that Melvyn Wolff,
the long-time controlling shareholder and CEO of Star, wanted to talk.
At our invitation, Melvyn came to the meeting and spent his time in Omaha
confirming his positive feelings about Berkshire. I, meanwhile, looked
at Star's financials, and liked what I saw. 
������ A few days later, Melvyn and I
met in New York and made a deal in a single, two-hour session. As was the
case with the Blumkins and Bill Child, I had no need to check leases, work
out employment contracts, etc. I knew I was dealing with a man of integrity
and that's what counted. 
������ Though the Wolff family's association
with Star dates back to 1924, the business struggled until Melvyn and his
sister Shirley Toomin took over in 1962. Today Star operates 12 stores
-- ten in Houston and one each in Austin and Bryan -- and will soon move
into San Antonio as well. We won't be surprised if Star is many times its
present size a decade from now. 
������ Here's a story illustrating what
Melvyn and Shirley are like: When they told their associates of the sale,
they also announced that Star would make large, special payments to those
who had helped them succeed -- and then defined that group as everyone
in the business. Under the terms of our deal, it was Melvyn and Shirley's
money, not ours, that funded this distribution. Charlie and I love it when
we become partners with people who behave like that. 
������ The Star transaction closed on
July 1. In the months since, we've watched Star's already-excellent sales
and earnings growth accelerate further. Melvyn and Shirley will be at the
annual meeting, and I hope you get a chance to meet them. 
������ Next acquisition: International
Dairy Queen. There are 5,792 Dairy Queen stores operating in 23 countries
-- all but a handful run by franchisees -- and in addition IDQ franchises
409 Orange Julius operations and 43 Karmelkorn operations. In 190 locations,
"treat centers" provide some combination of the three products.

������ For many years IDQ had a bumpy
history. Then, in 1970, a Minneapolis group led by John Mooty and Rudy
Luther took control. The new managers inherited a jumble of different franchising
agreements, along with some unwise financing arrangements that had left
the company in a precarious condition. In the years that followed, management
rationalized the operation, extended food service to many more locations,
and, in general, built a strong organization. 
������ Last summer Mr. Luther died, which
meant his estate needed to sell stock. A year earlier, Dick Kiphart of
William Blair & Co., had introduced me to John Mooty and Mike Sullivan,
IDQ's CEO, and I had been impressed with both men. So, when we got the
chance to merge with IDQ, we offered a proposition patterned on our FlightSafety
acquisition, extending selling shareholders the option of choosing either
cash or Berkshire shares having a slightly lower immediate value. By tilting
the consideration as we did, we encouraged holders to opt for cash, the
type of payment we by far prefer. Even then, only 45% of IDQ shares elected
cash. 
������ Charlie and I bring a modicum of
product expertise to this transaction: He has been patronizing the Dairy
Queens in Cass Lake and Bemidji, Minnesota, for decades, and I have been
a regular in Omaha. We have put our money where our mouth is. 


A Confession 


������ I've mentioned that we strongly
prefer to use cash rather than Berkshire stock in acquisitions. A study
of the record will tell you why: If you aggregate all of our stock-only
mergers (excluding those we did with two affiliated companies, Diversified
Retailing and Blue Chip Stamps), you will find that our shareholders are
slightly worse off than they would have been had I not done the transactions.
Though it hurts me to say it, when I've issued stock, I've cost you money.

������ Be clear about one thing: This
cost has not occurred because we were misled in any way by sellers
or because they thereafter failed to manage with diligence and skill. On
the contrary, the sellers were completely candid when we were negotiating
our deals and have been energetic and effective ever since. 
������ Instead, our problem has been that
we own a truly marvelous collection of businesses, which means that trading
away a portion of them for something new almost never makes sense. When
we issue shares in a merger, we reduce your ownership in all of our businesses
-- partly-owned companies such as Coca-Cola, Gillette and American Express,
and all of our terrific operating companies as well. An example from sports
will illustrate the difficulty we face: For a baseball team, acquiring
a player who can be expected to bat .350 is almost always a wonderful event
-- except when the team must trade a .380 hitter to make the deal.

������ Because our roster is filled with
.380 hitters, we have tried to pay cash for acquisitions, and here our
record has been far better. Starting with National Indemnity in 1967, and
continuing with, among others, See's, Buffalo News, Scott Fetzer and GEICO,
we have acquired -- for cash -- a number of large businesses that have
performed incredibly well since we bought them. These acquisitions have
delivered Berkshire tremendous value -- indeed, far more than I anticipated
when we made our purchases. 
������ We believe that it is almost impossible
for us to "trade up" from our present businesses and managements.
Our situation is the opposite of Camelot's Mordred, of whom Guenevere commented,
"The one thing I can say for him is that he is bound to marry well.
Everybody is above him." Marrying well is extremely difficult for
Berkshire. 
������ So you can be sure that Charlie
and I will be very reluctant to issue shares in the future. In those cases
when we simply must do so -- when certain shareholders of a desirable acquiree
insist on getting stock -- we will include an attractive cash option in
order to tempt as many of the sellers to take cash as is possible. 
������ Merging with public companies presents
a special problem for us. If we are to offer any premium to the
acquiree, one of two conditions must be present: Either our own stock must
be overvalued relative to the acquiree's, or the two companies together
must be expected to earn more than they would if operated separately. Historically,
Berkshire has seldom been overvalued. In this market, moreover, undervalued
acquirees are almost impossible to find. That other possibility -- synergy
gains -- is usually unrealistic, since we expect acquirees to operate after
we've bought them just as they did before. Joining with Berkshire does
not normally raise their revenues nor cut their costs. 


������ Indeed, their reported costs (but
not their true ones) will rise after they are bought by Berkshire
if the acquiree has been granting options as part of its compensation packages.
In these cases, "earnings" of the acquiree have been overstated
because they have followed the standard -- but, in our view, dead wrong
-- accounting practice of ignoring the cost to a business of issuing options.
When Berkshire acquires an option-issuing company, we promptly substitute
a cash compensation plan having an economic value equivalent to that of
the previous option plan. The acquiree's true compensation cost is thereby
brought out of the closet and charged, as it should be, against earnings.

������ The reasoning that Berkshire applies
to the merger of public companies should be the calculus for all
buyers. Paying a takeover premium does not make sense for any acquirer
unless a) its stock is overvalued relative to the acquiree's or b) the
two enterprises will earn more combined than they would separately. Predictably,
acquirers normally hew to the second argument because very few are willing
to acknowledge that their stock is overvalued. However, voracious buyers
-- the ones that issue shares as fast as they can print them -- are tacitly
conceding that point. (Often, also, they are running Wall Street's version
of a chain-letter scheme.) 
������ In some mergers there truly are
major synergies -- though oftentimes the acquirer pays too much to obtain
them -- but at other times the cost and revenue benefits that are projected
prove illusory. Of one thing, however, be certain: If a CEO is enthused
about a particularly foolish acquisition, both his internal staff and his
outside advisors will come up with whatever projections are needed to justify
his stance. Only in fairy tales are emperors told that they are naked.

GAAP cost. 


������ We made net sales during the year
that amounted to about 5% of our beginning portfolio. In these, we significantly
reduced a few of our holdings that are below the $750 million threshold
for itemization, and we also modestly trimmed a few of the larger positions
that we detail. Some of the sales we made during 1997 were aimed at changing
our bond-stock ratio moderately in response to the relative values that
we saw in each market, a realignment we have continued in 1998. 
������ Our reported positions, we should
add, sometimes reflect the investment decisions of GEICO's Lou Simpson.
Lou independently runs an equity portfolio of nearly $2 billion that may
at times overlap the portfolio that I manage, and occasionally he makes
moves that differ from mine. 
������ Though we don't attempt to predict
the movements of the stock market, we do try, in a very rough way, to value
it. At the annual meeting last year, with the Dow at 7,071 and long-term
Treasury yields at 6.89%, Charlie and I stated that we did not consider
the market overvalued if 1) interest rates remained where they were
or fell, and 2) American business continued to earn the remarkable returns
on equity that it had recently recorded. So far, interest rates have fallen
-- that's one requisite satisfied -- and returns on equity still remain
exceptionally high. If they stay there -- and if interest rates hold near
recent levels -- there is no reason to think of stocks as generally overvalued.
On the other hand, returns on equity are not a sure thing to remain at,
or even near, their present levels. 
������ In the summer of 1979, when equities
looked cheap to me, I wrote a Forbes article entitled "You
pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus."
At that time skepticism and disappointment prevailed, and my point was
that investors should be glad of the fact, since pessimism drives down
prices to truly attractive levels. Now, however, we have a very cheery
consensus. That does not necessarily mean this is the wrong time to buy
stocks: Corporate America is now earning far more money than it was just
a few years ago, and in the presence of lower interest rates, every dollar
of earnings becomes more valuable. Today's price levels, though, have materially
eroded the "margin of safety" that Ben Graham identified as the
cornerstone of intelligent investing. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
������ In last year's annual report, I
discussed Coca-Cola, our largest holding. Coke continues to increase its
market dominance throughout the world, but, tragically, it has lost the
leader responsible for its outstanding performance. Roberto Goizueta, Coke's
CEO since 1981, died in October. After his death, I read every one of the
more than 100 letters and notes he had written me during the past nine
years. Those messages could well serve as a guidebook for success in both
business and life. 
������ In these communications, Roberto
displayed a brilliant and clear strategic vision that was always aimed
at advancing the well-being of Coke shareholders. Roberto knew where he
was leading the company, how he was going to get there, and why this path
made the most sense for his owners -- and, equally important, he had a
burning sense of urgency about reaching his goals. An excerpt from one
handwritten note he sent to me illustrates his mind-set: "By the way,
I have told Olguita that what she refers to as an obsession, you call focus.
I like your term much better." Like all who knew Roberto, I will miss
him enormously. 
������ Consistent with his concern for
the company, Roberto prepared for a seamless succession long before it
seemed necessary. Roberto knew that Doug Ivester was the right man to take
over and worked with Doug over the years to ensure that no momentum would
be lost when the time for change arrived. The Coca-Cola Company will be
the same steamroller under Doug as it was under Roberto. 


Convertible Preferreds 


������ Two years ago, I gave you an update
on the five convertible preferreds that we purchased through private placements
in the 1987-1991 period. At the time of that earlier report, we had realized
a small profit on the sale of our Champion International holding. The four
remaining preferred commitments included two, Gillette and First Empire
State, that we had converted into common stock in which we had large unrealized
gains, and two others, USAir and Salomon, that had been trouble-prone.
At times, the last two had me mouthing a line from a country song: "How
can I miss you if you won't go away?" 
������ Since I delivered that report,
all four holdings have grown significantly in value. The common stocks
of both Gillette and First Empire have risen substantially, in line with
the companies' excellent performance. At yearend, the $600 million we put
into Gillette in 1989 had appreciated to $4.8 billion, and the $40 million
we committed to First Empire in 1991 had risen to $236 million. 
������ Our two laggards, meanwhile, have
come to life in a very major way. In a transaction that finally rewarded
its long-suffering shareholders, Salomon recently merged into Travelers
Group. All of Berkshire's shareholders -- including me, very personally
-- owe a huge debt to Deryck Maughan and Bob Denham for, first, playing
key roles in saving Salomon from extinction following its 1991 scandal
and, second, restoring the vitality of the company to a level that made
it an attractive acquisition for Travelers. I have often said that I wish
to work with executives that I like, trust and admire. No two fit that
description better than Deryck and Bob. 


������ Berkshire's final results from
its Salomon investment won't be tallied for some time, but it is safe to
say that they will be far better than I anticipated two years ago. Looking
back, I think of my Salomon experience as having been both fascinating
and instructional, though for a time in 1991-92 I felt like the drama critic
who wrote: "I would have enjoyed the play except that I had an unfortunate
seat. It faced the stage." 
������ The resuscitation of US Airways
borders on the miraculous. Those who have watched my moves in this investment
know that I have compiled a record that is unblemished by success. I was
wrong in originally purchasing the stock, and I was wrong later, in repeatedly
trying to unload our holdings at 50 cents on the dollar. 
������ Two changes at the company coincided
with its remarkable rebound: 1) Charlie and I left the board of directors
and 2) Stephen Wolf became CEO. Fortunately for our egos, the second event
was the key: Stephen Wolf's accomplishments at the airline have been phenomenal.

������ There still is much to do at US
Airways, but survival is no longer an issue. Consequently, the company
made up the dividend arrearages on our preferred during 1997, adding extra
payments to compensate us for the delay we suffered. The company's common
stock, furthermore, has risen from a low of $4 to a recent high of $73.

������ Our preferred has been called for
redemption on March 15. But the rise in the company's stock has given our
conversion rights, which we thought worthless not long ago, great value.
It is now almost certain that our US Airways shares will produce a decent
profit -- that is, if my cost for Maalox is excluded -- and the gain could
even prove indecent. 
������ Next time I make a big, dumb decision,
Berkshire shareholders will know what to do: Phone Mr. Wolf. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
������ In addition to the convertible
preferreds, we purchased one other private placement in 1991, $300 million
of American Express Percs. This security was essentially a common stock
that featured a tradeoff in its first three years: We received extra dividend
payments during that period, but we were also capped in the price appreciation
we could realize. Despite the cap, this holding has proved extraordinarily
profitable thanks to a move by your Chairman that combined luck and skill
-- 110% luck, the balance skill. 
������ Our Percs were due to convert into
common stock in August 1994, and in the month before I was mulling whether
to sell upon conversion. One reason to hold was Amex's outstanding CEO,
Harvey Golub, who seemed likely to maximize whatever potential the company
had (a supposition that has since been proved -- in spades). But the size
of that potential was in question: Amex faced relentless competition from
a multitude of card-issuers, led by Visa. Weighing the arguments, I leaned
toward sale. 
������ Here's where I got lucky. During
that month of decision, I played golf at Prouts Neck, Maine with Frank
Olson, CEO of Hertz. Frank is a brilliant manager, with intimate knowledge
of the card business. So from the first tee on I was quizzing him about
the industry. By the time we reached the second green, Frank had convinced
me that Amex's corporate card was a terrific franchise, and I had decided
not to sell. On the back nine I turned buyer, and in a few months Berkshire
owned 10% of the company. 
������ We now have a $3 billion gain in
our Amex shares, and I naturally feel very grateful to Frank. But George
Gillespie, our mutual friend, says that I am confused about where my gratitude
should go. After all, he points out, it was he who arranged the game and
assigned me to Frank's foursome. 
Quarterly Reports to Shareholders 
������ In last year's letter, I described
the growing costs we incur in mailing quarterly reports and the problems
we have encountered in delivering them to "street-name" shareholders.
I asked for your opinion about the desirability of our continuing to print
reports, given that we now publish our quarterly and annual communications
on the Internet, at our site, www.berkshirehathaway.com. Relatively few
shareholders responded, but it is clear that at least a small number who
want the quarterly information have no interest in getting it off the Internet.
Being a life-long sufferer from technophobia, I can empathize with this
group. 
������ The cost of publishing quarterlies,
however, continues to balloon, and we have therefore decided to send printed
versions only to shareholders who request them. If you wish the quarterlies,
please complete the reply card that is bound into this report. In the meantime,
be assured that all shareholders will continue to receive the annual
report in printed form. 
������ Those of you who enjoy the computer
should check out our home page. It contains a large amount of current information
about Berkshire and also all of our annual letters since 1977. In addition,
our website includes links to the home pages of many Berkshire subsidiaries.
On these sites you can learn more about our subsidiaries' products and
-- yes -- even place orders for them. 
������ We are required to file our quarterly
information with the SEC no later than 45 days after the end of each quarter.
One of our goals in posting communications on the Internet is to make this
material information -- in full detail and in a form unfiltered by the
media -- simultaneously available to all interested parties at a time when
markets are closed. Accordingly, we plan to send our 1998 quarterly information
to the SEC on three Fridays, May 15, August 14, and November 13, and on
those nights to post the same information on the Internet. This procedure
will put all of our shareholders, whether they be direct or "street-name,"
on an equal footing. Similarly, we will post our 1998 annual report on
the Internet on Saturday, March 13, 1999, and mail it at about the same
time. 


Shareholder-Designated Contributions 


������ About 97.7% of all eligible shares
participated in Berkshire's 1997 shareholder-designated contributions program.
Contributions made were $15.4 million, and 3,830 charities were recipients.
A full description of the program appears on pages 52 - 53. 
������ Cumulatively, over the 17 years
of the program, Berkshire has made contributions of $113.1 million pursuant
to the instructions of our shareholders. The rest of Berkshire's giving
is done by our subsidiaries, which stick to the philanthropic patterns
that prevailed before they were acquired (except that their former owners
themselves take on the responsibility for their personal charities). In
aggregate, our subsidiaries made contributions of $8.1 million in 1997,
including in-kind donations of $4.4 million. 
������ Every year a few shareholders miss
out on our contributions program because they don't have their shares registered
in their own names on the prescribed record date or because they fail to
get the designation form back to us within the 60-day period allowed. Charlie
and I regret this. But if replies are received late, we have to reject
them because we can't make exceptions for some shareholders while refusing
to make them for others. 
������ To participate in future programs,
you must own Class A shares that are registered in the name of the actual
owner, not the nominee name of a broker, bank or depository. Shares not
so registered on August 31, 1998, will be ineligible for the 1998 program.
When you get the contributions form from us, return it promptly so that
it does not get put aside or forgotten. 
The Annual Meeting 


������ Woodstock Weekend at Berkshire
will be May 2-4 this year. The finale will be the annual meeting, which
will begin at 9:30 a.m. on Monday, May 4. Last year we met at Aksarben
Coliseum, and both our staff and the crowd were delighted with the venue.
There was only one crisis: The night before the meeting, I lost my voice,
thereby fulfilling Charlie's wildest fantasy. He was crushed when I showed
up the next morning with my speech restored. 
������ Last year about 7,500 attended
the meeting. They represented all 50 states, as well as 16 countries, including
Australia, Brazil, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Greece. Taking into
account several overflow rooms, we believe that we can handle more than
11,000 people, and that should put us in good shape this year even though
our shareholder count has risen significantly. Parking is ample at Aksarben;
acoustics are excellent; and seats are comfortable. 
������ The doors will open at 7 a.m. on
Monday and at 8:30 we will again feature the world premiere of a movie
epic produced by Marc Hamburg, our CFO. The meeting will last until 3:30,
with a short break at noon. This interval will permit the exhausted to
leave unnoticed and allow time for the hardcore to lunch at Aksarben's
concession stands. Charlie and I enjoy questions from owners, so bring
up whatever is on your mind. 
������ Berkshire products will again be
for sale in the halls outside the meeting room. Last year -- not
that I pay attention to this sort of thing -- we again set sales records,
moving 2,500 pounds of See's candy, 1,350 pairs of Dexter shoes, $75,000
of World Books and related publications, and 888 sets of Quikut knives.
We also took orders for a new line of apparel, featuring our Berkshire
logo, and sold about 1,000 polo, sweat, and T-shirts. At this year's meeting,
we will unveil our 1998 collection. 
������ GEICO will again be on hand with
a booth staffed by star associates from its regional offices. Find out
whether you can save money by shifting your auto insurance to GEICO. About
40% of those who check us out learn that savings are possible. The proportion
is not 100% because insurers differ in their underwriting judgments, with
some favoring drivers who live in certain geographical areas and work at
certain occupations more than we do. We believe, however, that we more
frequently offer the low price than does any other national carrier selling
insurance to all comers. In the GEICO informational material that accompanies
this report, you will see that in 38 states we now offer a special discount
of as much as 8% to our shareholders. We also have applications pending
that would extend this discount to drivers in other states. 
������ An attachment to the proxy material
that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the card
you will need for admission to the meeting. We expect a large crowd, so
get plane, hotel and car reservations promptly. American Express (800-799-6634)
will be happy to help you with arrangements. As usual, we will have buses
at the larger hotels that will take you to and from the meeting and also
deliver you to Nebraska Furniture Mart, Borsheim's and the airport after
its conclusion. You are likely, however, to find a car handy. 
������ NFM's main store, located on a
75-acre site about a mile from Aksarben, is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.
on weekdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays, and noon to 6 p.m. on Sundays.
During the period from May 1 to May 5, shareholders who present NFM with
the coupon that will accompany their meeting ticket will be entitled to
a discount that is otherwise restricted to its employees. 
������ Borsheim's normally is closed on
Sunday but will be open for shareholders from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on May
3rd. Last year was our second-best shareholder's day, exceeded only by
1996's. I regard this slippage as an anomaly and hope that you will prove
me right this year. Charlie will be available for autographs. He smiles,
however, only if the paper he signs is a Borsheim's sales ticket. Shareholders
who wish to visit on Saturday (10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.) or on Monday (10 a.m.-8
p.m.) should be sure to identify themselves as Berkshire owners so that
Susan Jacques, Borsheim's CEO, can make you especially welcome. Susan,
I should add, had a fabulous year in 1997. As a manager, she is everything
that an owner hopes for. 
������ On Sunday afternoon we will also
have a special treat for bridge players in the mall outside of Borsheim's.
There, Bob Hamman -- a legend of the game for more than three decades --
will take on all comers. Join in and dazzle Bob with your skill. 
������ My favorite steakhouse, Gorat's,
opens one Sunday a year -- for Berkshire shareholders on the night before
the annual meeting. Last year the restaurant started serving at 4 p.m.
and finished about 1:30 a.m, an endurance trial that was the result of
taking 1,100 reservations vs. a seating capacity of 235. If you make a
reservation and then can't attend, be sure to let Gorat's know promptly,
since it goes to great effort to help us and we want to reciprocate. You
can make reservations beginning on April 1st (but not before) by
calling 402-551-3733. Last year I had to leave Gorat's a little early because
of my voice problem, but this year I plan to leisurely savor every bite
of my rare T-bone and double order of hash browns. 
������ After this warmup, Charlie and
I will head for the Dairy Queen on 114th, just south of Dodge. There are
12 great Dairy Queens in metropolitan Omaha, but the 114th Street location
is the best suited to handle the large crowd that we expect. South of the
property, there are hundreds of parking spaces on both sides of the street.
Also, this Dairy Queen will extend its Sunday hours to 11 p.m. in order
to accommodate our shareholders. 
������ The 114th Street operation is now
run by two sisters, Coni Birge and Deb Novotny, whose grandfather put up
the building in 1962 at what was then the outer edge of the city. Their
mother, Jan Noble, took over in 1972, and Coni and Deb continue as third
generation owner-managers. Jan, Coni and Deb will all be on hand Sunday
evening, and I hope that you meet them. Enjoy one of their hamburgers if
you can't get into Gorat's. And then, around eight o'clock, join me in
having a Dusty Sundae for dessert. This item is a personal specialty --
the Dairy Queen will furnish you a copy of my recipe -- and will be offered
only on Shareholder Sunday. 
������ The Omaha Royals and Albuquerque
Dukes will play baseball on Saturday evening, May 2nd, at Rosenblatt Stadium.
As usual, your Chairman, shamelessly exploiting his 25% ownership of the
team, will take the mound. But this year you will see something new. 
������ In past games, much to the bafflement
of the crowd, I have shaken off the catcher's first call. He has consistently
asked for my sweeping curve, and I have just as regularly resisted. Instead,
I have served up a pathetic fast ball, which on my best day was clocked
at eight miles per hour (with a following wind). 
������ There's a story behind my unwillingness
to throw the curve ball. As some of you may know, Candy Cummings invented
the curve in 1867 and used it to great effect in the National Association,
where he never won less than 28 games in a season. The pitch, however,
drew immediate criticism from the very highest of authorities, namely Charles
Elliott, then president of Harvard University, who declared, "I have
heard that this year we at Harvard won the baseball championship because
we have a pitcher who has a fine curve ball. I am further instructed that
the purpose of the curve ball is to deliberately deceive the batter. Harvard
is not in the business of teaching deception." (I'm not making this
up.) 
������ Ever since I learned of President
Elliott's moral teachings on this subject, I have scrupulously refrained
from using my curve, however devastating its effect might have been on
hapless batters. Now, however, it is time for my karma to run over Elliott's
dogma and for me to quit holding back. Visit the park on Saturday night
and marvel at the majestic arc of my breaking ball. 
������ Our proxy statement includes information
about obtaining tickets to the game. We will also provide an information
packet describing the local hot spots, including, of course, those 12 Dairy
Queens. 
������ Come to Omaha -- the cradle of
capitalism -- in May and enjoy yourself.

Chairman's Letter - 1998

BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.
To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. :
� � � � �Our gain in net worth during 1998 was $25.9 billion, which increased the per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stock by 48.3%. Over the last 34 years (that is, since present management took over) per-share book value has grown from $19 to $37,801, a rate of 24.7% compounded annually.* 

                            
* All figures used in this report apply to Berkshire's A shares, the successor to the only stock that the company had outstanding before 1996. The B shares have an economic interest equal to 1/30th that of the A.
                            
� � � � �Normally, a gain of 48.3% would call for handsprings -- but not this year. Remember Wagner, whose music has been described as better than it sounds? Well, Berkshire's progress in 1998 -- though more than satisfactory -- was not as good as it looks. That's because most of that 48.3% gain came from our issuing shares in acquisitions. 
� � � � �To explain: Our stock sells at a large premium over book value, which means that any issuing of shares we do -- whether for cash or as consideration in a merger -- instantly increases our per-share book-value figure, even though we've earned not a dime. What happens is that we get more per-share book value in such transactions than we give up. These transactions, however, do not deliver us any immediate gain in per-share intrinsic value, because in this respect what we give and what we get are roughly equal. And, as Charlie Munger, Berkshire's Vice Chairman and my partner, and I can't tell you too often (though you may feel that we try), it's the per-share gain in intrinsic value that counts rather than the per-share gain in book value. Though Berkshire's intrinsic value grew very substantially in 1998, the gain fell well short of the 48.3% recorded for book value. Nevertheless, intrinsic value still far exceeds book value. (For a more extensive discussion of these terms, and other investment and accounting concepts, please refer to our Owner's Manual, on pages 56-64, in which we set forth our owner-related business principles. Intrinsic value is discussed on pages 61 and 62.) 
� � � � �We entered 1999 with the best collection of businesses and managers in our history. The two companies we acquired in 1998, General Re and Executive Jet, are first-class in every way -- more about both later -- and the performance of our operating businesses last year exceeded my hopes. GEICO, once again, simply shot the lights out. On the minus side, several of the public companies in which we have major investments experienced significant operating shortfalls that neither they nor I anticipated early in the year. Consequently, our equity portfolio did not perform nearly as well as did the S&P 500. The problems of these companies are almost certainly temporary, and Charlie and I believe that their long-term prospects are excellent. 
� � � � �In our last three annual reports, we furnished you a table that we regard as central to estimating Berkshire's intrinsic value. In the updated version of that table, which follows, we trace our two key components of value, including General Re on a pro-forma basis as if we had owned it throughout the year. The first column lists our per-share ownership of investments (including cash and equivalents but excluding securities held in our financial products operation) and the second column shows our per-share earnings from Berkshire's operating businesses before taxes and purchase-accounting adjustments (discussed on pages 62 and 63), but after all interest and corporate expenses. The second column excludes all dividends, interest and capital gains that we realized from the investments presented in the first column. In effect, the columns show how Berkshire would look if it were split into two parts, with one entity holding our investments and the other operating all of our businesses and bearing all corporate costs.

Annual Growth Rate, 1968-1998 ...................

25.4%

18.6%


� � � � �During 1998, our investments increased by $9,604 per share, or 25.2%, but per-share operating earnings fell by 33.9%. General Re (included, as noted, on a pro-forma basis) explains both facts. This company has very large investments, and these greatly increased our per-share investment figure. But General Re also had an underwriting loss in 1998, and that hurt operating earnings. Had we not acquired General Re, per-share operating earnings would have shown a modest gain. 
� � � � �Though certain of our acquisitions and operating strategies may from time to time affect one column more than the other, we continually work to increase the figures in both. But one thing is certain: Our future rates of gain will fall far short of those achieved in the past. Berkshire's capital base is now simply too large to allow us to earn truly outsized returns. If you believe otherwise, you should consider a career in sales but avoid one in mathematics (bearing in mind that there are really only three kinds of people in the world: those who can count and those who can't). 
� � � � �Currently we are working to compound a net worth of $57.4 billion, the largest of any American corporation (though our figure will be eclipsed if the merger of Exxon and Mobil takes place). Of course, our lead in net worth does not mean that Berkshire outranks all other businesses in value: Market value is what counts for owners and General Electric and Microsoft, for example, have valuations more than three times Berkshire's. Net worth, though, measures the capital that managers must deploy, and at Berkshire that figure has indeed become huge. 
� � � � �Nonetheless, Charlie and I will do our best to increase intrinsic value in the future at an average rate of 15%, a result we consider to be at the very peak of possible outcomes. We may have years when we exceed 15%, but we will most certainly have other years when we fall far short of that -- including years showing negative returns -- and those will bring our average down. In the meantime, you should understand just what an average gain of 15% over the next five years implies: It means we will need to increase net worth by $58 billion. Earning this daunting 15% will require us to come up with big ideas: Popcorn stands just won't do. Today's markets are not friendly to our search for "elephants," but you can be sure that we will stay focused on the hunt. 
� � � � �Whatever the future holds, I make you one promise: I'll keep at least 99% of my net worth in Berkshire for as long as I am around. How long will that be? My model is the loyal Democrat in Fort Wayne who asked to be buried in Chicago so that he could stay active in the party. To that end, I've already selected a "power spot" at the office for my urn. 
* * * * * * * * * * * *
� � � � �Our financial growth has been matched by employment growth: We now have 47,566 on our payroll, with the acquisitions of 1998 bringing 7,074 employees to us and internal growth adding another 2,500. To balance this gain of 9,500 in hands-on employees, we have enlarged the staff at world headquarters from 12 to 12.8. (The .8 doesn't refer to me or Charlie: We have a new person in accounting, working four days a week.) Despite this alarming trend toward corporate bloat, our after-tax overhead last year was about $3.5 million, or well under one basis point (.01 of 1%) of the value of the assets we manage. 
Taxes 
� � � � �One beneficiary of our increased size has been the U.S. Treasury. The federal income taxes that Berkshire and General Re have paid, or will soon pay, in respect to 1998 earnings total $2.7 billion. That means we shouldered all of the U.S. Government's expenses for more than a half-day. 
� � � � �Follow that thought a little further: If only 625 other U.S. taxpayers had paid the Treasury as much as we and General Re did last year, no one else -- neither corporations nor 270 million citizens -- would have had to pay federal income taxes or any other kind of federal tax (for example, social security or estate taxes). Our shareholders can truly say that they "gave at the office." 
� � � � �Writing checks to the IRS that include strings of zeros does not bother Charlie or me. Berkshire as a corporation, and we as individuals, have prospered in America as we would have in no other country. Indeed, if we lived in some other part of the world and completely escaped taxes, I'm sure we would be worse off financially (and in many other ways as well). Overall, we feel extraordinarily lucky to have been dealt a hand in life that enables us to write large checks to the government rather than one requiring the government to regularly write checks to us -- say, because we are disabled or unemployed. 
� � � � �Berkshire's tax situation is sometimes misunderstood. First, capital gains have no special attraction for us: A corporation pays a 35% rate on taxable income, whether it comes from capital gains or from ordinary operations. This means that Berkshire's tax on a long-term capital gain is fully 75% higher than what an individual would pay on an identical gain. 
� � � � �Some people harbor another misconception, believing that we can exclude 70% of all dividends we receive from our taxable income. Indeed, the 70% rate applies to most corporations and also applies to Berkshire in cases where we hold stocks in non-insurance subsidiaries. However, almost all of our equity investments are owned by our insurance companies, and in that case the exclusion is 59.5%. That still means a dollar of dividends is considerably more valuable to us than a dollar of ordinary income, but not to the degree often assumed. 
* * * * * * * * * * * *
� � � � �Berkshire truly went all out for the Treasury last year. In connection with the General Re merger, we wrote a $30 million check to the government to pay an SEC fee tied to the new shares created by the deal. We understand that this payment set an SEC record. Charlie and I are enormous admirers of what the Commission has accomplished for American investors. We would rather, however, have found another way to show our admiration. 
GEICO (1-800-847-7536) 
� � � � �Combine a great idea with a great manager and you're certain to obtain a great result. That mix is alive and well at GEICO. The idea is low-cost auto insurance, made possible by direct-to-customer marketing, and the manager is Tony Nicely. Quite simply, there is no one in the business world who could run GEICO better than Tony does. His instincts are unerring, his energy is boundless, and his execution is flawless. While maintaining underwriting discipline, Tony is building an organization that is gaining market share at an accelerating rate. 
� � � � �This pace has been encouraged by our compensation policies. The direct writing of insurance -- that is, without there being an agent or broker between the insurer and its policyholder -- involves a substantial front-end investment. First-year business is therefore unprofitable in a major way. At GEICO, we do not wish this cost to deter our associates from the aggressive pursuit of new business -- which, as it renews, will deliver significant profits -- so we leave it out of our compensation formulas. What's included then? We base 50% of our associates' bonuses and profit sharing on the earnings of our "seasoned" book, meaning policies that have been with us for more than a year. The other 50% is tied to growth in policyholders -- and here we have stepped on the gas. 
� � � � �In 1995, the year prior to its acquisition by Berkshire, GEICO spent $33 million on marketing and had 652 telephone counselors. Last year the company spent $143 million, and the counselor count grew to 2,162. The effects that these efforts had at the company are shown by the new business and in-force figures below:

* "Voluntary" only; excludes assigned risks and the like. 
� � � � �In 1999, we will again increase our marketing budget, spending at least $190 million. In fact, there is no limit to what Berkshire is willing to invest in GEICO's new-business activity, as long as we can concurrently build the infrastructure the company needs to properly serve its policyholders. 
� � � � �Because of the first-year costs, companies that are concerned about quarterly or annual earnings would shy from similar investments, no matter how intelligent these might be in terms of building long-term value. Our calculus is different: We simply measure whether we are creating more than a dollar of value per dollar spent -- and if that calculation is favorable, the more dollars we spend the happier I am. 
� � � � �There is far more to GEICO's success, of course, than low prices and a torrent of advertising. The handling of claims must also be fair, fast and friendly -- and ours is. Here's an impartial scorecard on how we shape up: In New York, our largest-volume state, the Insurance Department recently reported that GEICO's complaint ratio in 1997 was not only the lowest of the five largest auto insurers but was also less than half the average of the other four. 
� � � � �GEICO's 1998 profit margin of 6.7% was better than we had anticipated -- and, indeed, better than we wished. Our results reflect an industry-wide phenomenon: In recent years, both the frequency of auto accidents and their severity have unexpectedly declined. We responded by reducing rates 3.3% in 1998, and we will reduce them still more in 1999. These moves will soon bring profit margins down -- at the least to 4%, which is our target, and perhaps considerably lower. Whatever the case, we believe that our margins will continue to be much better than those of the industry. 
� � � � �With GEICO's growth and profitability both outstanding in 1998, so also were its profit-sharing and bonus payments. Indeed, the profit-sharing payment of $103 million or 32.3% of salary -- which went to all 9,313 associates who had been with us for more than a year -- may well have been the highest percentage payment at any large company in the country. (In addition, associates benefit from a company-funded pension plan.) 
� � � � �The 32.3% may turn out to be a high-water mark, given that the profitability component in our profit-sharing calculation is almost certain to come down in the future. The growth component, though, may well increase. Overall, we expect the two benchmarks together to dictate very significant profit-sharing payments for decades to come. For our associates, growth pays off in other ways as well: Last year we promoted 4,612 people. 
� � � � �Impressive as the GEICO figures are, we have far more to do. Our market share improved significantly in 1998 -- but only from 3% to 3�%. For every policyholder we now have, there are another ten who should be giving us their business. 
� � � � �Some of you who are reading this may be in that category. About 40% of those who check our rates find that they can save money by doing business with us. The proportion is not 100% because insurers differ in their underwriting judgements, with some giving more credit than we do to drivers who live in certain geographical areas or work at certain occupations. We believe, however, that we more frequently offer the low price than does any other national carrier selling insurance to all comers. Furthermore, in 40 states we can offer a special discount -- usually 8% -- to our shareholders. So give us a call and check us out. 
* * * * * * * * * * * *
� � � � �You may think that one commercial in this section is enough. But I have another to present, this one directed at managers of publicly-owned companies. 
� � � � �At Berkshire we feel that telling outstanding CEOs, such as Tony, how to run their companies would be the height of foolishness. Most of our managers wouldn't work for us if they got a lot of backseat driving. (Generally, they don't have to work for anyone, since 75% or so are independently wealthy.) Besides, they are the Mark McGwires of the business world and need no advice from us as to how to hold the bat or when to swing. 
� � � � �Nevertheless, Berkshire's ownership may make even the best of managers more effective. First, we eliminate all of the ritualistic and nonproductive activities that normally go with the job of CEO. Our managers are totally in charge of their personal schedules. Second, we give each a simple mission: Just run your business as if: 1) you own 100% of it; 2) it is the only asset in the world that you and your family have or will ever have; and 3) you can't sell or merge it for at least a century. As a corollary, we tell them they should not let any of their decisions be affected even slightly by accounting considerations. We want our managers to think about what counts, not how it will be counted. 
� � � � �Very few CEOs of public companies operate under a similar mandate, mainly because they have owners who focus on short-term prospects and reported earnings. Berkshire, however, has a shareholder base -- which it will have for decades to come -- that has the longest investment horizon to be found in the public-company universe. Indeed, a majority of our shares are held by investors who expect to die still holding them. We can therefore ask our CEOs to manage for maximum long-term value, rather than for next quarter's earnings. We certainly don't ignore the current results of our businesses -- in most cases, they are of great importance -- but we never want them to be achieved at the expense of our building ever-greater competitive strengths. 
� � � � �I believe the GEICO story demonstrates the benefits of Berkshire's approach. Charlie and I haven't taught Tony a thing -- and never will -- but we have created an environment that allows him to apply all of his talents to what's important. He does not have to devote his time or energy to board meetings, press interviews, presentations by investment bankers or talks with financial analysts. Furthermore, he need never spend a moment thinking about financing, credit ratings or "Street" expectations for earnings per share. Because of our ownership structure, he also knows that this operational framework will endure for decades to come. In this environment of freedom, both Tony and his company can convert their almost limitless potential into matching achievements. 
� � � � �If you are running a large, profitable business that will thrive in a GEICO-like environment, check our acquisition criteria on page 21 and give me a call. I promise a fast answer and will mention your inquiry to no one except Charlie. 
Executive Jet Aviation (1-800-848-6436) 
� � � � �To understand the huge potential at Executive Jet Aviation (EJA), you need some understanding of its business, which is selling fractional shares of jets and operating the fleet for its many owners. Rich Santulli, CEO of EJA, created the fractional ownership industry in 1986, by visualizing an important new way of using planes. Then he combined guts and talent to turn his idea into a major business. 
� � � � �In a fractional ownership plan, you purchase a portion -- say 1/8th -- of any of a wide variety of jets that EJA offers. That purchase entitles you to 100 hours of flying time annually. ("Dead-head" hours don't count against your allotment, and you are also allowed to average your hours over five years.) In addition, you pay both a monthly management fee and a fee for hours actually flown. 
� � � � �Then, on a few hours notice, EJA makes your plane, or another at least as good, available to you at your choice of the 5500 airports in the U.S. In effect, calling up your plane is like phoning for a taxi. 
� � � � �I first heard about the NetJets� program, as it is called, about four years ago from Frank Rooney, our manager at H.H. Brown. Frank had used and been delighted with the service and suggested that I meet Rich to investigate signing up for my family's use. It took Rich about 15 minutes to sell me a quarter (200 hours annually) of a Hawker 1000. Since then, my family has learned firsthand -- through flying 900 hours on 300 trips -- what a friendly, efficient, and safe operation EJA runs. Quite simply, they love this service. In fact, they quickly grew so enthusiastic that I did a testimonial ad for EJA long before I knew there was any possibility of our purchasing the business. I did, however, ask Rich to give me a call if he ever got interested in selling. Luckily, he phoned me last May, and we quickly made a $725 million deal, paying equal amounts of cash and stock. 
� � � � �EJA, which is by far the largest operator in its industry, has more than 1,000 customers and 163 aircraft (including 23 "core" aircraft that are owned or leased by EJA itself, so that it can make sure that service is first-class even during the times when demand is heaviest). Safety, of course, is the paramount issue in any flight operation, and Rich's pilots -- now numbering about 650 -- receive extensive training at least twice a year from FlightSafety International, another Berkshire subsidiary and the world leader in pilot training. The bottom line on our pilots: I've sold the Berkshire plane and will now do all of my business flying, as well as my personal flying, with NetJets' crews. 
� � � � �Being the leader in this industry is a major advantage for all concerned. Our customers gain because we have an armada of planes positioned throughout the country at all times, a blanketing that allows us to provide unmatched service. Meanwhile, we gain from the blanketing because it reduces dead-head costs. Another compelling attraction for our clients is that we offer products from Boeing, Gulfstream, Falcon, Cessna, and Raytheon, whereas our two competitors are owned by manufacturers that offer only their own planes. In effect, NetJets is like a physician who can recommend whatever medicine best fits the needs of each patient; our competitors, in contrast, are producers of a "house" brand that they must prescribe for one and all. 
� � � � �In many cases our clients, both corporate and individual, own fractions of several different planes and can therefore match specific planes to specific missions. For example, a client might own 1/16th of three different jets (each giving it 50 hours of flying time), which in total give it a virtual fleet, obtained for a small fraction of the cost of a single plane. 
� � � � �Significantly, it is not only small businesses that can benefit from fractional ownership. Already, some of America's largest companies use NetJets as a supplement to their own fleet. This saves them big money in both meeting peak requirements and in flying missions that would require their wholly-owned planes to log a disproportionate amount of dead-head hours. 
� � � � �When a plane is slated for personal use, the clinching argument is that either the client signs up now or his children likely will later. That's an equation I explained to my wonderful Aunt Alice 40 years ago when she asked me whether she could afford a fur coat. My reply settled the issue: "Alice, you aren't buying it; your heirs are." 
� � � � �EJA's growth has been explosive: In 1997, it accounted for 31% of all corporate jets ordered in the world. Nonetheless, Rich and I believe that the potential of fractional ownership has barely been scratched. If many thousands of owners find it sensible to own 100% of a plane -- which must be used 350-400 hours annually if it's to make economic sense -- there must be a large multiple of that number for whom fractional ownership works. 
� � � � �In addition to being a terrific executive, Rich is fun. Like most of our managers, he has no economic need whatsoever to work. Rich spends his time at EJA because it's his baby -- and he wants to see how far he can take it. We both already know the answer, both literally and figuratively: to the ends of the earth. 
* * * * * * * * * * * *
� � � � �And now a small hint to Berkshire directors: Last year I spent more than nine times my salary at Borsheim's and EJA. Just think how Berkshire's business would boom if you'd only spring for a raise. 
General Re 
� � � � �On December 21, we completed our $22 billion acquisition of General Re Corp. In addition to owning 100% of General Reinsurance Corporation, the largest U.S. property-casualty reinsurer, the company also owns (including stock it has an arrangement to buy) 82% of the oldest reinsurance company in the world, Cologne Re. The two companies together reinsure all lines of insurance and operate in 124 countries. 
� � � � �For many decades, General Re's name has stood for quality, integrity and professionalism in reinsurance -- and under Ron Ferguson's leadership, this reputation has been burnished still more. Berkshire can add absolutely nothing to the skills of General Re's and Cologne Re's managers. On the contrary, there is a lot that they can teach us. 
� � � � �Nevertheless, we believe that Berkshire's ownership will benefit General Re in important ways and that its earnings a decade from now will materially exceed those that would have been attainable absent the merger. We base this optimism on the fact that we can offer General Re's management a freedom to operate in whatever manner will best allow the company to exploit its strengths. 
� � � � �Let's look for a moment at the reinsurance business to understand why General Re could not on its own do what it can under Berkshire. Most of the demand for reinsurance comes from primary insurers who want to escape the wide swings in earnings that result from large and unusual losses. In effect, a reinsurer gets paid for absorbing the volatility that the client insurer wants to shed. 
� � � � �Ironically, though, a publicly-held reinsurer gets graded by both its owners and those who evaluate its credit on the smoothness of its own results. Wide swings in earnings hurt both credit ratings and p/e ratios, even when the business that produces such swings has an expectancy of satisfactory profits over time. This market reality sometimes causes a reinsurer to make costly moves, among them laying off a significant portion of the business it writes (in transactions that are called "retrocessions") or rejecting good business simply because it threatens to bring on too much volatility. 
� � � � �Berkshire, in contrast, happily accepts volatility, just as long as it carries with it the expectation of increased profits over time. Furthermore, we are a Fort Knox of capital, and that means volatile earnings can't impair our premier credit ratings. Thus we have the perfect structure for writing -- and retaining -- reinsurance in virtually any amount. In fact, we've used this strength over the past decade to build a powerful super-cat business. 
� � � � �What General Re gives us, however, is the distribution force, technical facilities and management that will allow us to employ our structural strength in every facet of the industry. In particular, General Re and Cologne Re can now accelerate their push into international markets, where the preponderance of industry growth will almost certainly occur. As the merger proxy statement spelled out, Berkshire also brings tax and investment benefits to General Re. But the most compelling reason for the merger is simply that General Re's outstanding management can now do what it does best, unfettered by the constraints that have limited its growth. 
� � � � �Berkshire is assuming responsibility for General Re's investment portfolio, though not for Cologne Re's. We will not, however, be involved in General Re's underwriting. We will simply ask the company to exercise the discipline of the past while increasing the proportion of its business that is retained, expanding its product line, and widening its geographical coverage -- making these moves in recognition of Berkshire's financial strength and tolerance for wide swings in earnings. As we've long said, we prefer a lumpy 15% return to a smooth 12%. 
� � � � �Over time, Ron and his team will maximize General Re's new potential. He and I have known each other for many years, and each of our companies has initiated significant business that it has reinsured with the other. Indeed, General Re played a key role in the resuscitation of GEICO from its near-death status in 1976. 
� � � � �Both Ron and Rich Santulli plan to be at the annual meeting, and I hope you get a chance to say hello to them. 
The Economics of Property-Casualty Insurance 
� � � � �With the acquisition of General Re -- and with GEICO's business mushrooming -- it becomes more important than ever that you understand how to evaluate an insurance company. The key determinants are: (1) the amount of float that the business generates; (2) its cost; and (3) most important of all, the long-term outlook for both of these factors. 
� � � � �To begin with, float is money we hold but don't own. In an insurance operation, float arises because premiums are received before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes extends over many years. During that time, the insurer invests the money. Typically, this pleasant activity carries with it a downside: The premiums that an insurer takes in usually do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay. That leaves it running an "underwriting loss," which is the cost of float. An insurance business has value if its cost of float over time is less than the cost the company would otherwise incur to obtain funds. But the business is a lemon if its cost of float is higher than market rates for money. 
� � � � �A caution is appropriate here: Because loss costs must be estimated, insurers have enormous latitude in figuring their underwriting results, and that makes it very difficult for investors to calculate a company's true cost of float. Errors of estimation, usually innocent but sometimes not, can be huge. The consequences of these miscalculations flow directly into earnings. An experienced observer can usually detect large-scale errors in reserving, but the general public can typically do no more than accept what's presented, and at times I have been amazed by the numbers that big-name auditors have implicitly blessed. As for Berkshire, Charlie and I attempt to be conservative in presenting its underwriting results to you, because we have found that virtually all surprises in insurance are unpleasant ones. 
� � � � �The table that follows shows the float generated by Berkshire's insurance operations since we entered the business 32 years ago. The data are for every fifth year and also the last, which includes General Re's huge float. For the table we have calculated our float -- which we generate in large amounts relative to our premium volume -- by adding net loss reserves, loss adjustment reserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned premium reserves, and then subtracting agents balances, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid taxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance. (Got that?)

� � � � �Impressive as the growth in our float has been -- 25.4% compounded annually -- what really counts is the cost of this item. If that becomes too high, growth in float becomes a curse rather than a blessing. 
� � � � �At Berkshire, the news is all good: Our average cost over the 32 years has been well under zero. In aggregate, we have posted a substantial underwriting profit, which means that we have been paid for holding a large and growing amount of money. This is the best of all worlds. Indeed, though our net float is recorded on our balance sheet as a liability, it has had more economic value to us than an equal amount of net worth would have had. As long as we can continue to achieve an underwriting profit, float will continue to outrank net worth in value. 
� � � � �During the next few years, Berkshire's growth in float may well be modest. The reinsurance market is soft, and in this business, relationships change slowly. Therefore, General Re's float -- 2/3rds of our total -- is unlikely to increase significantly in the near term. We do expect, however, that our cost of float will remain very attractive compared to that of other insurers. 
Sources of Reported Earnings 
� � � � �The table that follows shows the main sources of Berkshire's reported earnings. In this presentation, purchase-accounting adjustments are not assigned to the specific businesses to which they apply, but are instead aggregated and shown separately. This procedure lets you view the earnings of our businesses as they would have been reported had we not purchased them. For the reasons discussed on pages 62 and 63, this form of presentation seems to us to be more useful to investors and managers than one utilizing generally-accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which require purchase-premiums to be charged off business-by-business. The total earnings we show in the table are, of course, identical to the GAAP total in our audited financial statements.

� � � � �You can be proud of our operating managers. They almost invariably deliver earnings that are at the very top of what conditions in their industries allow, meanwhile fortifying their businesses' long-term competitive strengths. In aggregate, they have created many billions of dollars of value for you. 
� � � � �An example: In my 1994 letter, I reported on Ralph Schey's extraordinary performance at Scott Fetzer. Little did I realize that he was just warming up. Last year Scott Fetzer, operating with no leverage (except for a conservative level of debt in its finance subsidiary), earned a record $96.5 million after-tax on its $112 million net worth. 
� � � � �Today, Berkshire has an unusually large number of individuals, such as Ralph, who are truly legends in their industries. Many of these joined us when we purchased their companies, but in recent years we have also identified a number of strong managers internally. We further expanded our corps of all-stars in an important way when we acquired General Re and EJA. 
� � � � �Charlie and I have the easy jobs at Berkshire: We do very little except allocate capital. And, even then, we are not all that energetic. We have one excuse, though: In allocating capital, activity does not correlate with achievement. Indeed, in the fields of investments and acquisitions, frenetic behavior is often counterproductive. Therefore, Charlie and I mainly just wait for the phone to ring. 
� � � � �Our managers, however, work very hard -- and it shows. Naturally, they want to be paid fairly for their efforts, but pay alone can't explain their extraordinary accomplishments. Instead, each is primarily motivated by a vision of just how far his or her business can go -- and by a desire to be the one who gets it there. Charlie and I thank them on your behalf and ours. 
* * * * * * * * * * * *
� � � � �Additional information about our various businesses is given on pages 39-53, where you will also find our segment earnings reported on a GAAP basis. In addition, on pages 65-71, we have rearranged Berkshire's financial data into four segments on a non-GAAP basis, a presentation that corresponds to the way Charlie and I think about the company. 
� � � � �Normally, we follow this section with one on "Look-Through" Earnings. Because the General Re acquisition occurred near yearend, though, neither a historical nor a pro-forma calculation of a 1998 number seems relevant. We will resume the look-through calculation in next year's report.

� � � � �* Represents tax-basis cost which, in aggregate, is $1.5 billion less than GAAP cost. 
� � � � �During the year, we slightly increased our holdings in American Express, one of our three largest commitments, and left the other two unchanged. However, we trimmed or substantially cut many of our smaller positions. Here, I need to make a confession (ugh): The portfolio actions I took in 1998 actually decreased our gain for the year. In particular, my decision to sell McDonald's was a very big mistake. Overall, you would have been better off last year if I had regularly snuck off to the movies during market hours. 
� � � � �At yearend, we held more than $15 billion in cash equivalents (including high-grade securities due in less than one year). Cash never makes us happy. But it's better to have the money burning a hole in Berkshire's pocket than resting comfortably in someone else's. Charlie and I will continue our search for large equity investments or, better yet, a really major business acquisition that would absorb our liquid assets. Currently, however, we see nothing on the horizon. 
� � � � �Once we knew that the General Re merger would definitely take place, we asked the company to dispose of the equities that it held. (As mentioned earlier, we do not manage the Cologne Re portfolio, which includes many equities.) General Re subsequently eliminated its positions in about 250 common stocks, incurring $935 million of taxes in the process. This "clean sweep" approach reflects a basic principle that Charlie and I employ in business and investing: We don't back into decisions. 
� � � � �Last year I deviated from my standard practice of not disclosing our investments (other than those we are legally required to report) and told you about three unconventional investments we had made. There were several reasons behind that disclosure. First, questions about our silver position that we had received from regulatory authorities led us to believe that they wished us to publicly acknowledge this investment. Second, our holdings of zero-coupon bonds were so large that we wanted our owners to know of this investment's potential impact on Berkshire's net worth. Third, we simply wanted to alert you to the fact that we sometimes do make unconventional commitments. 
� � � � �Normally, however, as discussed in the Owner's Manual on page 61, we see no advantage in talking about specific investment actions. Therefore -- unless we again take a position that is particularly large -- we will not post you as to what we are doing in respect to any specific holding of an unconventional sort. We can report, however, that we have eliminated certain of the positions discussed last year and added certain others. 
� � � � �Our never-comment-even-if-untrue policy in regard to investments may disappoint "piggybackers" but will benefit owners: Your Berkshire shares would be worth less if we discussed what we are doing. Incidentally, we should warn you that media speculation about our investment moves continues in most cases to be incorrect. People who rely on such commentary do so at their own peril. 
Accounting -- Part 1 
� � � � �Our General Re acquisition put a spotlight on an egregious flaw in accounting procedure. Sharp-eyed shareholders reading our proxy statement probably noticed an unusual item on page 60. In the pro-forma statement of income -- which detailed how the combined 1997 earnings of the two entities would have been affected by the merger -- there was an item stating that compensation expense would have been increased by $63 million. 
� � � � �This item, we hasten to add, does not signal that either Charlie or I have experienced a major personality change. (He still travels coach and quotes Ben Franklin.) Nor does it indicate any shortcoming in General Re's accounting practices, which have followed GAAP to the letter. Instead, the pro-forma adjustment came about because we are replacing General Re's longstanding stock option plan with a cash plan that ties the incentive compensation of General Re managers to their operating achievements. Formerly what counted for these managers was General Re's stock price; now their payoff will come from the business performance they deliver. 
� � � � �The new plan and the terminated option arrangement have matching economics, which means that the rewards they deliver to employees should, for a given level of performance, be the same. But what these people could have formerly anticipated earning from new option grants will now be paid in cash. (Options granted in past years remain outstanding.) 
� � � � �Though the two plans are an economic wash, the cash plan we are putting in will produce a vastly different accounting result. This Alice-in-Wonderland outcome occurs because existing accounting principles ignore the cost of stock options when earnings are being calculated, even though options are a huge and increasing expense at a great many corporations. In effect, accounting principles offer management a choice: Pay employees in one form and count the cost, or pay them in another form and ignore the cost. Small wonder then that the use of options has mushroomed. This lop-sided choice has a big downside for owners, however: Though options, if properly structured, can be an appropriate, and even ideal, way to compensate and motivate top managers, they are more often wildly capricious in their distribution of rewards, inefficient as motivators, and inordinately expensive for shareholders. 
� � � � �Whatever the merits of options may be, their accounting treatment is outrageous. Think for a moment of that $190 million we are going to spend for advertising at GEICO this year. Suppose that instead of paying cash for our ads, we paid the media in ten-year, at-the-market Berkshire options. Would anyone then care to argue that Berkshire had not borne a cost for advertising, or should not be charged this cost on its books? 
� � � � �Perhaps Bishop Berkeley -- you may remember him as the philosopher who mused about trees falling in a forest when no one was around -- would believe that an expense unseen by an accountant does not exist. Charlie and I, however, have trouble being philosophical about unrecorded costs. When we consider investing in an option-issuing company, we make an appropriate downward adjustment to reported earnings, simply subtracting an amount equal to what the company could have realized by publicly selling options of like quantity and structure. Similarly, if we contemplate an acquisition, we include in our evaluation the cost of replacing any option plan. Then, if we make a deal, we promptly take that cost out of hiding. 
� � � � �Readers who disagree with me about options will by this time be mentally quarreling with my equating the cost of options issued to employees with those that might theoretically be sold and traded publicly. It is true, to state one of these arguments, that employee options are sometimes forfeited -- that lessens the damage done to shareholders -- whereas publicly-offered options would not be. It is true, also, that companies receive a tax deduction when employee options are exercised; publicly-traded options deliver no such benefit. But there's an offset to these points: Options issued to employees are often repriced, a transformation that makes them much more costly than the public variety. 
� � � � �It's sometimes argued that a non-transferable option given to an employee is less valuable to him than would be a publicly-traded option that he could freely sell. That fact, however, does not reduce the cost of the non-transferable option Giving an employee a company car that can only be used for certain purposes diminishes its value to the employee, but does not in the least diminish its cost to the employer. 
� � � � �The earning revisions that Charlie and I have made for options in recent years have frequently cut the reported per-share figures by 5%, with 10% not all that uncommon. On occasion, the downward adjustment has been so great that it has affected our portfolio decisions, causing us either to make a sale or to pass on a stock purchase we might otherwise have made. 
� � � � �A few years ago we asked three questions in these pages to which we have not yet received an answer: "If options aren't a form of compensation, what are they? If compensation isn't an expense, what is it? And, if expenses shouldn't go into the calculation of earnings, where in the world should they go?" 
Accounting -- Part 2 
� � � � �The role that managements have played in stock-option accounting has hardly been benign: A distressing number of both CEOs and auditors have in recent years bitterly fought FASB's attempts to replace option fiction with truth and virtually none have spoken out in support of FASB. Its opponents even enlisted Congress in the fight, pushing the case that inflated figures were in the national interest. 
� � � � �Still, I believe that the behavior of managements has been even worse when it comes to restructurings and merger accounting. Here, many managements purposefully work at manipulating numbers and deceiving investors. And, as Michael Kinsley has said about Washington: "The scandal isn't in what's done that's illegal but rather in what's legal." 
� � � � �It was once relatively easy to tell the good guys in accounting from the bad: The late 1960's, for example, brought on an orgy of what one charlatan dubbed "bold, imaginative accounting" (the practice of which, incidentally, made him loved for a time by Wall Street because he never missed expectations). But most investors of that period knew who was playing games. And, to their credit, virtually all of America's most-admired companies then shunned deception. 
� � � � �In recent years, probity has eroded. Many major corporations still play things straight, but a significant and growing number of otherwise high-grade managers -- CEOs you would be happy to have as spouses for your children or as trustees under your will -- have come to the view that it's okay to manipulate earnings to satisfy what they believe are Wall Street's desires. Indeed, many CEOs think this kind of manipulation is not only okay, but actually their duty. 
� � � � �These managers start with the assumption, all too common, that their job at all times is to encourage the highest stock price possible (a premise with which we adamantly disagree). To pump the price, they strive, admirably, for operational excellence. But when operations don't produce the result hoped for, these CEOs resort to unadmirable accounting stratagems. These either manufacture the desired "earnings" or set the stage for them in the future. 
� � � � �Rationalizing this behavior, these managers often say that their shareholders will be hurt if their currency for doing deals -- that is, their stock -- is not fully-priced, and they also argue that in using accounting shenanigans to get the figures they want, they are only doing what everybody else does. Once such an everybody's-doing-it attitude takes hold, ethical misgivings vanish. Call this behavior Son of Gresham: Bad accounting drives out good. 
� � � � �The distortion du jour is the "restructuring charge," an accounting entry that can, of course, be legitimate but that too often is a device for manipulating earnings. In this bit of legerdemain, a large chunk of costs that should properly be attributed to a number of years is dumped into a single quarter, typically one already fated to disappoint investors. In some cases, the purpose of the charge is to clean up earnings misrepresentations of the past, and in others it is to prepare the ground for future misrepresentations. In either case, the size and timing of these charges is dictated by the cynical proposition that Wall Street will not mind if earnings fall short by $5 per share in a given quarter, just as long as this deficiency ensures that quarterly earnings in the future will consistently exceed expectations by five cents per share. 
� � � � �This dump-everything-into-one-quarter behavior suggests a corresponding "bold, imaginative" approach to -- golf scores. In his first round of the season, a golfer should ignore his actual performance and simply fill his card with atrocious numbers -- double, triple, quadruple bogeys -- and then turn in a score of, say, 140. Having established this "reserve," he should go to the golf shop and tell his pro that he wishes to "restructure" his imperfect swing. Next, as he takes his new swing onto the course, he should count his good holes, but not the bad ones. These remnants from his old swing should be charged instead to the reserve established earlier. At the end of five rounds, then, his record will be 140, 80, 80, 80, 80 rather than 91, 94, 89, 94, 92. On Wall Street, they will ignore the 140 -- which, after all, came from a "discontinued" swing -- and will classify our hero as an 80 shooter (and one who never disappoints). 
� � � � �For those who prefer to cheat up front, there would be a variant of this strategy. The golfer, playing alone with a cooperative caddy-auditor, should defer the recording of bad holes, take four 80s, accept the plaudits he gets for such athleticism and consistency, and then turn in a fifth card carrying a 140 score. After rectifying his earlier scorekeeping sins with this "big bath," he may mumble a few apologies but will refrain from returning the sums he has previously collected from comparing scorecards in the clubhouse. (The caddy, need we add, will have acquired a loyal patron.) 
� � � � �Unfortunately, CEOs who use variations of these scoring schemes in real life tend to become addicted to the games they're playing -- after all, it's easier to fiddle with the scorecard than to spend hours on the practice tee -- and never muster the will to give them up. Their behavior brings to mind Voltaire's comment on sexual experimentation: "Once a philosopher, twice a pervert." 
� � � � �In the acquisition arena, restructuring has been raised to an art form: Managements now frequently use mergers to dishonestly rearrange the value of assets and liabilities in ways that will allow them to both smooth and swell future earnings. Indeed, at deal time, major auditing firms sometimes point out the possibilities for a little accounting magic (or for a lot). Getting this push from the pulpit, first-class people will frequently stoop to third-class tactics. CEOs understandably do not find it easy to reject auditor-blessed strategies that lead to increased future "earnings."
� � � � �An example from the property-casualty insurance industry will illuminate the possibilities. When a p-c company is acquired, the buyer sometimes simultaneously increases its loss reserves, often substantially. This boost may merely reflect the previous inadequacy of reserves -- though it is uncanny how often an actuarial "revelation" of this kind coincides with the inking of a deal. In any case, the move sets up the possibility of 'earnings" flowing into income at some later date, as reserves are released. 
� � � � �Berkshire has kept entirely clear of these practices: If we are to disappoint you, we would rather it be with our earnings than with our accounting. In all of our acquisitions, we have left the loss reserve figures exactly as we found them. After all, we have consistently joined with insurance managers knowledgeable about their business and honest in their financial reporting. When deals occur in which liabilities are increased immediately and substantially, simple logic says that at least one of those virtues must have been lacking -- or, alternatively, that the acquirer is laying the groundwork for future infusions of "earnings." 
� � � � �Here's a true story that illustrates an all-too-common view in corporate America. The CEOs of two large banks, one of them a man who'd made many acquisitions, were involved not long ago in a friendly merger discussion (which in the end didn't produce a deal). The veteran acquirer was expounding on the merits of the possible combination, only to be skeptically interrupted by the other CEO: "But won't that mean a huge charge," he asked, "perhaps as much as $1 billion?" The "sophisticate" wasted no words: "We'll make it bigger than that -- that's why we're doing the deal." 
� � � � �A preliminary tally by R. G. Associates, of Baltimore, of special charges taken or announced during 1998 -- that is, charges for restructuring, in-process R&D, merger-related items, and write-downs -- identified no less than 1,369 of these, totaling $72.1 billion. That is a staggering amount as evidenced by this bit of perspective: The 1997 earnings of the 500 companies in Fortune's famous list totaled $324 billion. 
� � � � �Clearly the attitude of disrespect that many executives have today for accurate reporting is a business disgrace. And auditors, as we have already suggested, have done little on the positive side. Though auditors should regard the investing public as their client, they tend to kowtow instead to the managers who choose them and dole out their pay. ("Whose bread I eat, his song I sing.") 
� � � � �A big piece of news, however, is that the SEC, led by its chairman, Arthur Levitt, seems determined to get corporate America to clean up its act. In a landmark speech last September, Levitt called for an end to "earnings management." He correctly observed, "Too many corporate managers, auditors and analysts are participants in a game of nods and winks." And then he laid on a real indictment: "Managing may be giving way to manipulating; integrity may be losing out to illusion." 
� � � � �I urge you to read the Chairman's speech (you can find it on the Internet at www.sec.gov) and to support him in his efforts to get corporate America to deliver a straight story to its owners. Levitt's job will be Herculean, but it is hard to think of another more important for him to take on. 
Reports to Shareholders 
� � � � �Berkshire's Internet site, www.berkshirehathaway.com, has become a prime source for information about the company. While we continue to send an annual report to all shareholders, we now send quarterlies only to those who request them, letting others read these at our site. In this report, we again enclose a card that can be returned by those wanting to get printed quarterlies in 1999. 
� � � � �Charlie and I have two simple goals in reporting: 1) We want to give you the information that we would wish you to give us if our positions were reversed; and 2) We want to make Berkshire's information accessible to all of you simultaneously. Our ability to reach that second goal is greatly helped by the Internet. 
� � � � �In another portion of his September speech, Arthur Levitt deplored what he called "selective disclosure." His remarks were timely: Today, many companies matter-of-factly favor Wall Street analysts and institutional investors in a variety of ways that often skirt or cross the line of unfairness. These practices leave the great bulk of shareholders at a distinct disadvantage to a favored class. 
� � � � �At Berkshire, we regard the holder of one share of B stock as the equal of our large institutional investors. We, of course, warmly welcome institutions as owners and have gained a number of them through the General Re merger. We hope also that these new holders find that our owner's manual and annual reports offer them more insights and information about Berkshire than they garner about other companies from the investor relations departments that these corporations typically maintain. But if it is "earnings guidance" or the like that shareholders or analysts seek, we will simply guide them to our public documents. 
� � � � �This year we plan to post our quarterly reports on the Internet after the close of the market on May 14, August 13, and November 12. We also expect to put the 1999 annual report on our website on Saturday, March 11, 2000, and to mail the print version at roughly the same time. 
� � � � �We promptly post press releases on our website. This means that you do not need to rely on the versions of these reported by the media but can instead read the full text on your computer. 
� � � � �Despite the pathetic technical skills of your Chairman, I'm delighted to report that GEICO, Borsheim's, See's, and The Buffalo News are now doing substantial business via the Internet. We've also recently begun to offer annuity products on our website. This business was developed by Ajit Jain, who over the last decade has personally accounted for a significant portion of Berkshire's operating earnings. While Charlie and I sleep, Ajit keeps thinking of new ways to add value to Berkshire. 
Shareholder-Designated Contributions 
� � � � �About 97.5% of all eligible shares participated in Berkshire's 1998 shareholder-designated contributions program, with contributions totaling $16.9 million. A full description of the program appears on pages 54-55. 
� � � � �Cumulatively, over the 18 years of the program, Berkshire has made contributions of $130 million pursuant to the instructions of our shareholders. The rest of Berkshire's giving is done by our subsidiaries, which stick to the philanthropic patterns that prevailed before they were acquired (except that their former owners themselves take on the responsibility for their personal charities). In aggregate, our subsidiaries made contributions of $12.5 million in 1998, including in-kind donations of $2.0 million. 
� � � � �To participate in future programs, you must own Class A shares that are registered in the name of the actual owner, not the nominee name of a broker, bank or depository. Shares not so registered on August 31, 1999, will be ineligible for the 1999 program. When you get the contributions form from us, return it promptly so that it does not get put aside or forgotten. Designations received after the due date will not be honored. 
The Annual Meeting 
� � � � �This year's Woodstock for Capitalists will be held May 1-3, and we may face a problem. Last year more than 10,000 people attended our annual meeting, and our shareholders list has since doubled. So we don't quite know what attendance to expect this year. To be safe, we have booked both Aksarben Coliseum, which holds about 14,000 and the Holiday Convention Centre, which can seat an additional 5,000. Because we know that our Omaha shareholders will want to be good hosts to the out-of-towners (many of them come from outside the U.S), we plan to give those visitors first crack at the Aksarben tickets and to subsequently allocate these to greater Omaha residents on a first-come, first-served basis. If we exhaust the Aksarben tickets, we will begin distributing Holiday tickets to Omaha shareholders. 
� � � � �If we end up using both locations, Charlie and I will split our pre-meeting time between the two. Additionally, we will have exhibits and also the Berkshire movie, large television screens and microphones at both sites. When we break for lunch, many attendees will leave Aksarben, which means that those at Holiday can, if they wish, make the five-minute trip to Aksarben and finish out the day there. Buses will be available to transport people who don't have cars. 
� � � � �The doors will open at both locations at 7 a.m. on Monday, and at 8:30 we will premier the 1999 Berkshire movie epic, produced by Marc Hamburg, our CFO. The meeting will last from 9:30 until 3:30, interrupted only by the short lunch break. 
� � � � �An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the badge you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. As for plane, hotel and car reservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. In our normal fashion, we will run buses from the larger hotels to the meeting. After the meeting, these will make trips back to the hotels and to Nebraska Furniture Mart, Borsheim's and the airport. Even so, you are likely to find a car useful. 
� � � � �The full line of Berkshire products will be available at Aksarben, and the more popular items will also be at Holiday. Last year we set sales records across-the-board, moving 3,700 pounds of See's candy, 1,635 pairs of Dexter shoes, 1,150 sets of Quikut knives and 3,104 Berkshire shirts and hats. Additionally, $26,944 of World Book products were purchased as well as more than 2,000 golf balls with the Berkshire Hathaway logo. Charlie and I are pleased but not satisfied with these numbers and confidently predict new records in all categories this year. Our 1999 apparel line will be unveiled at the meeting, so please defer your designer purchases until you view our collection. 
� � � � �Dairy Queen will also be on hand and will again donate all proceeds to the Children's Miracle Network. Last year we sold about 4,000 Dilly� bars, fudge bars and vanilla/orange bars. Additionally, GEICO will have a booth that will be manned by a number of our top counselors from around the country, all of them ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In almost all cases, GEICO will be able to offer you a special shareholder's discount. Check out whether we can save you some money. 
� � � � �The piece de resistance of our one-company trade show will be a 79-foot-long, nearly 12-foot-wide, fully-outfitted cabin of a 737 Boeing Business Jet ("BBJ"), which is NetJets' newest product. This plane has a 14-hour range; is designed to carry 19 passengers; and offers a bedroom, an office, and two showers. Deliveries to fractional owners will begin in the first quarter of 2000. 
� � � � �The BBJ will be available for your inspection on May 1-3 near the entrance to the Aksarben hall. You should be able to minimize your wait by making your visit on Saturday or Sunday. Bring along your checkbook in case you decide to make an impulse purchase. 
� � � � �NFM's multi-stored complex, located on a 75-acre site about a mile from Aksarben, is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. This operation did $300 million in business during 1998 and offers an unrivaled breadth of merchandise -- furniture, electronics, appliances, carpets and computers -- all at can't-be-beat prices. During the April 30th to May 4th period, shareholders presenting their meeting badge will receive a discount that is customarily given only to its employees. 
� � � � �Borsheim's normally is closed on Sunday but will be open for shareholders from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on May 2nd. On annual meeting weekend last year, the store did an incredible amount of business. Sales were double those of the previous year, and the store's volume on Sunday greatly exceeded volume for any day in Borsheim's history. Charlie attributes this record to the fact that he autographed sales tickets that day and, while I have my doubts about this proposition, we are not about to mess with a winning formula. Please give him writer's cramp. On last year's Sunday, Borsheim's wrote 2,501 tickets during the eight hours it was open. For those of you who are mathematically challenged, that is one ticket every 11 seconds. 
� � � � �Shareholders who wish to avoid Sunday's crowd can visit Borsheim's on Saturday (10 a.m.-5:30 p.m.) or on Monday (10 a.m.-8 p.m.). Be sure to identify yourself as a Berkshire owner so that Susan Jacques, Borsheim's CEO, can quote you a "shareholder-weekend" price. Susan joined us in 1983 as a $4-per-hour salesperson and was made CEO in 1994. This move ranks as one of my best managerial decisions. 
� � � � �Bridge players can look forward to a thrill on Sunday, when Bob Hamman -- the best the game has ever seen -- will turn up to play with our shareholders in the mall outside of Borsheim's. Bob plays without sorting his cards -- hey, maybe that's what's wrong with my game. We will also have a couple of other tables at which another expert or two will be playing. 
� � � � �Gorat's -- my favorite steakhouse -- will again be open especially for Berkshire shareholders on the Sunday night before the meeting. Though Gorat's served from 4 p.m. until about 1 a.m. last year, its crew was swamped, and some of our shareholders had an uncomfortable wait. This year fewer reservations will be accepted, and we ask that you don't come on Sunday without a reservation. In other years, many of our shareholders have chosen to visit Gorat's on Friday, Saturday or Monday. You can make reservations beginning on April 1 (but not before) by calling 402-551-3733. The cognoscenti will continue to order rare T-bones with double orders of hash browns. 
� � � � �The Omaha Golden Spikes (ne� the Omaha Royals) will meet the Iowa Cubs on Saturday evening, May 1st, at Rosenblatt Stadium. Your Chairman, whose breaking ball had the crowd buzzing last year, will again take the mound. This year I plan to introduce my "flutterball." It's a real source of irritation to me that many view our annual meeting as a financial event rather than the sports classic I consider it to be. Once the world sees my flutterball, that misperception will be erased. 
� � � � �Our proxy statement includes instructions about obtaining tickets to the game and also a large quantity of other information that should help you to enjoy your visit. I particularly urge the 60,000 shareholders that we gained through the Gen Re merger to join us. Come and meet your fellow capitalists.

� � � � �It wouldn't be right to close without a word about the 11.8 people who work with me in Berkshire's corporate office. In addition to handling the myriad of tax, regulatory and administrative matters that come with owning dozens of businesses, this group efficiently and cheerfully manages various special projects, some of which generate hundreds of inquiries. Here's a sample of what went on in 1998:

6,106 shareholders designated 3,880 charities to receive contributions. 
Kelly Muchemore processed about 17,500 admission tickets for the annual meeting, along with orders and checks for 3,200 baseball tickets. 
Kelly and Marc Hamburg produced and directed the Aksarben extravaganza, a job that required them to arrange the presentations made by our subsidiaries, prepare our movie, and sometimes lend people a hand with travel and lodging. 
Debbie Bosanek satisfied the varying needs of the 46 media organizations (13 of them non-U.S.) that covered the meeting, and meanwhile, as always, skillfully assisted me in every aspect of my job. 
Debbie and Marc assembled the data for our annual report and oversaw the production and distribution of 165,000 copies. (This year the number will be 325,000.) 
Marc handled 95% of the details -- and much of the substance -- connected with our completing two major mergers. 
Kelly, Debbie and Deb Ray dealt efficiently with tens of thousands of requests for annual reports and financial information that came through the office.
� � � � �You and I are paying for only 11.8 people, but we are getting what would at most places be the output of 100. To all of the 11.8, my thanks.

Chairman's Letter - 1999









�
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. 

�
        To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:
 �����Our gain in net worth during 1999 
              was $358 million, which increased the per-share book value of both 
              our Class A and Class B stock by 0.5%. Over the last 35 years (that 
              is, since present management took over) per-share book value has 
              grown from $19 to $37,987, a rate of 24.0% compounded annually.* 

*�����All figures used in this report apply 
          to Berkshire's A shares, the successor to the only stock that the company 
          had outstanding before 1996. The B shares have an economic interest 
          equal to 1/30th that of the A. 
       	

 �����The numbers on the facing page show 
              just how poor our 1999 record was. We had the worst absolute performance 
              of my tenure and, compared to the S&P, the worst relative performance 
              as well. Relative results are what concern us: Over time, bad relative 
              numbers will produce unsatisfactory absolute results.
 �����Even Inspector Clouseau could find 
              last year's guilty party: your Chairman. My performance reminds 
              me of the quarterback whose report card showed four Fs and a D but 
              who nonetheless had an understanding coach. "Son," he drawled, "I 
              think you're spending too much time on that one subject." 
             �����My "one subject" is capital allocation, 
              and my grade for 1999 most assuredly is a D. What most hurt us during 
              the year was the inferior performance of Berkshire's equity portfolio 
              -- and responsibility for that portfolio, leaving aside the small 
              piece of it run by Lou Simpson of GEICO, is entirely mine. Several 
              of our largest investees badly lagged the market in 1999 because 
              they've had disappointing operating results. We still like these 
              businesses and are content to have major investments in them. But 
              their stumbles damaged our performance last year, and it's no sure 
              thing that they will quickly regain their stride. 
             �����The fallout from our weak results 
              in 1999 was a more-than-commensurate drop in our stock price. In 
              1998, to go back a bit, the stock outperformed the business. Last 
              year the business did much better than the stock, a divergence that 
              has continued to the date of this letter. Over time, of course, 
              the performance of the stock must roughly match the performance 
              of the business. 
             �����Despite our poor showing last year, 
              Charlie Munger, Berkshire's Vice Chairman and my partner, and I 
              expect that the gain in Berkshire's intrinsic value over the next 
              decade will modestly exceed the gain from owning the S&P. We 
              can't guarantee that, of course. But we are willing to back our 
              conviction with our own money. To repeat a fact you've heard before, 
              well over 99% of my net worth resides in Berkshire. Neither my wife 
              nor I have ever sold a share of Berkshire and -- unless our checks 
              stop clearing -- we have no intention of doing so. 
             �����Please note that I spoke of hoping 
              to beat the S&P "modestly." For Berkshire, truly large superiorities 
              over that index are a thing of the past. They existed then because 
              we could buy both businesses and stocks at far more attractive prices 
              than we can now, and also because we then had a much smaller capital 
              base, a situation that allowed us to consider a much wider range 
              of investment opportunities than are available to us today. 
             �����Our optimism about Berkshire's performance 
              is also tempered by the expectation -- indeed, in our minds, the 
              virtual certainty -- that the S&P will do far less well in the 
              next decade or two than it has done since 1982. A recent article 
              in Fortune expressed my views as to why this is inevitable, and 
              I'm enclosing a copy with this report. 
             �����Our goal is to run our present businesses 
              well -- a task made easy because of the outstanding managers we 
              have in place -- and to acquire additional businesses having economic 
              characteristics and managers comparable to those we already own. 
              We made important progress in this respect during 1999 by acquiring 
              Jordan's Furniture and contracting to buy a major portion of MidAmerican 
              Energy. We will talk more about these companies later in the report 
              but let me emphasize one point here: We bought both for cash, issuing 
              no Berkshire shares. Deals of that kind aren't always possible, 
              but that is the method of acquisition that Charlie and I vastly 
              prefer.

Guides to Intrinsic Value 

 �����I often talk in 
              these pages about intrinsic value, a key, though far from precise, 
              measurement we utilize in our acquisitions of businesses and common 
              stocks. (For an extensive discussion of this, and other investment 
              and accounting terms and concepts, please refer to our Owner's Manual 
              on pages 55 - 62. Intrinsic value is discussed on page 60.) 
             �����In our last four reports, we have 
              furnished you a table that we regard as useful in estimating Berkshire's 
              intrinsic value. In the updated version of that table, which follows, 
              we trace two key components of value. The first column lists our 
              per-share ownership of investments (including cash and equivalents 
              but excluding assets held in our financial products operation) and 
              the second column shows our per-share earnings from Berkshire's 
              operating businesses before taxes and purchase-accounting adjustments 
              (discussed on page 61), but after all interest and corporate expenses. 
              The second column excludes all dividends, interest and 
              capital gains that we realized from the investments presented in 
              the first column. In effect, the columns show how Berkshire would 
              look if it were split into two parts, with one entity holding our 
              investments and the other operating all of our businesses and bearing 
              all corporate costs.

�����In 1999, our per-share investments 
              changed very little, but our operating earnings, affected by negatives 
              that overwhelmed some strong positives, fell apart. Most of our 
              operating managers deserve a grade of A for delivering fine results 
              and for having widened the difference between the intrinsic value 
              of their businesses and the value at which these are carried on 
              our balance sheet. But, offsetting this, we had a huge -- and, I 
              believe, aberrational -- underwriting loss at General Re. Additionally, 
              GEICO's underwriting profit fell, as we had predicted it would. 
              GEICO's overall performance, though, was terrific, outstripping 
              my ambitious goals. 
             �����We do not expect our underwriting 
              earnings to improve in any dramatic way this year. Though GEICO's 
              intrinsic value should grow by a highly satisfying amount, its underwriting 
              performance is almost certain to weaken. That's because auto insurers, 
              as a group, will do worse in 2000, and because we will materially 
              increase our marketing expenditures. At General Re, we are raising 
              rates and, if there is no mega-catastrophe in 2000, the company's 
              underwriting loss should fall considerably. It takes some time, 
              however, for the full effect of rate increases to kick in, and General 
              Re is therefore likely to have another unsatisfactory underwriting 
              year. 

 �����You should be aware that one item 
              regularly working to widen the amount by which intrinsic value exceeds 
              book value is the annual charge against income we take for amortization 
              of goodwill -- an amount now running about $500 million. This charge 
              reduces the amount of goodwill we show as an asset and likewise 
              the amount that is included in our book value. This is an accounting 
              matter having nothing to do with true economic goodwill, which increases 
              in most years. But even if economic goodwill were to remain constant, 
              the annual amortization charge would persistently widen the gap 
              between intrinsic value and book value. 
             �����Though we can't give you a precise 
              figure for Berkshire's intrinsic value, or even an approximation, 
              Charlie and I can assure you that it far exceeds our $57.8 billion 
              book value. Businesses such as See's and Buffalo News are now worth 
              fifteen to twenty times the value at which they are carried on our 
              books. Our goal is to continually widen this spread at all subsidiaries. 
              

A Managerial Story You Will Never Read Elsewhere 

 �����Berkshire's collection of managers 
              is unusual in several important ways. As one example, a very high percentage 
              of these men and women are independently wealthy, having made fortunes 
              in the businesses that they run. They work neither because they 
              need the money nor because they are contractually obligated to -- 
              we have no contracts at Berkshire. Rather, they work long and hard 
              because they love their businesses. And I use the word "their" advisedly, 
              since these managers are truly in charge -- there are no show-and-tell 
              presentations in Omaha, no budgets to be approved by headquarters, 
              no dictums issued about capital expenditures. We simply ask our 
              managers to run their companies as if these are the sole asset of 
              their families and will remain so for the next century. 
             �����Charlie and I try to behave with 
              our managers just as we attempt to behave with Berkshire's shareholders, 
              treating both groups as we would wish to be treated if our positions 
              were reversed. Though "working" means nothing to me financially, 
              I love doing it at Berkshire for some simple reasons: It gives me 
              a sense of achievement, a freedom to act as I see fit and an opportunity 
              to interact daily with people I like and trust. Why should our managers 
              -- accomplished artists at what they do -- see things differently? 
             �����In their relations with Berkshire, 
              our managers often appear to be hewing to President Kennedy's charge, 
              "Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for 
              your country." Here's a remarkable story from last year: It's about 
              R. C. Willey, Utah's dominant home furnishing business, which Berkshire 
              purchased from Bill Child and his family in 1995. Bill and most 
              of his managers are Mormons, and for this reason R. C. Willey's 
              stores have never operated on Sunday. This is a difficult way to 
              do business: Sunday is the favorite shopping day for many customers. 
              Bill, nonetheless, stuck to his principles -- and while doing so 
              built his business from $250,000 of annual sales in 1954, when he 
              took over, to $342 million in 1999. 
             �����Bill felt that R. C. Willey could 
              operate successfully in markets outside of Utah and in 1997 suggested 
              that we open a store in Boise. I was highly skeptical about taking 
              a no-Sunday policy into a new territory where we would be up against 
              entrenched rivals open seven days a week. Nevertheless, this was 
              Bill's business to run. So, despite my reservations, I told him 
              to follow both his business judgment and his religious convictions. 
             �����Bill then insisted on a truly extraordinary 
              proposition: He would personally buy the land and build the store 
              -- for about $9 million as it turned out -- and would sell it to 
              us at his cost if it proved to be successful. On the other hand, 
              if sales fell short of his expectations, we could exit the business 
              without paying Bill a cent. This outcome, of course, would leave 
              him with a huge investment in an empty building. I told him that 
              I appreciated his offer but felt that if Berkshire was going to 
              get the upside it should also take the downside. Bill said nothing 
              doing: If there was to be failure because of his religious beliefs, 
              he wanted to take the blow personally. 
             �����The store opened last August and 
              immediately became a huge success. Bill thereupon turned the property 
              over to us -- including some extra land that had appreciated significantly 
              -- and we wrote him a check for his cost. And get this: Bill 
              refused to take a dime of interest on the capital he had tied up 
              over the two years. 

 ������If a manager has behaved similarly 
              at some other public corporation, I haven't heard about it. You 
              can understand why the opportunity to partner with people like Bill 
              Child causes me to tap dance to work every morning.

�����A footnote: After our "soft" opening 
              in August, we had a grand opening of the Boise store about a month 
              later. Naturally, I went there to cut the ribbon (your Chairman, 
              I wish to emphasize, is good for something). In my talk 
              I told the crowd how sales had far exceeded expectations, making 
              us, by a considerable margin, the largest home furnishings store 
              in Idaho. Then, as the speech progressed, my memory miraculously 
              began to improve. By the end of my talk, it all had come back to 
              me: Opening a store in Boise had been my idea. 

The Economics of Property/Casualty Insurance 

 ������Our main business -- though 
              we have others of great importance -- is insurance. To understand 
              Berkshire, therefore, it is necessary that you understand how to 
              evaluate an insurance company. The key determinants are: (1) the 
              amount of float that the business generates; (2) its cost; and (3) 
              most critical of all, the long-term outlook for both of these factors. 
             �����To begin with, float is money we 
              hold but don't own. In an insurance operation, float arises because 
              premiums are received before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes 
              extends over many years. During that time, the insurer invests the 
              money. This pleasant activity typically carries with it a downside: 
              The premiums that an insurer takes in usually do not cover the losses 
              and expenses it eventually must pay. That leaves it running an "underwriting 
              loss," which is the cost of float. An insurance business has value 
              if its cost of float over time is less than the cost the company 
              would otherwise incur to obtain funds. But the business is a lemon 
              if its cost of float is higher than market rates for money. 
             �����A caution is appropriate here: Because 
              loss costs must be estimated, insurers have enormous latitude in 
              figuring their underwriting results, and that makes it very difficult 
              for investors to calculate a company's true cost of float. Errors 
              of estimation, usually innocent but sometimes not, can be huge. 
              The consequences of these miscalculations flow directly into earnings. 
              An experienced observer can usually detect large-scale errors in 
              reserving, but the general public can typically do no more than 
              accept what's presented, and at times I have been amazed by the 
              numbers that big-name auditors have implicitly blessed. In 1999 
              a number of insurers announced reserve adjustments that made a mockery 
              of the "earnings" that investors had relied on earlier when making 
              their buy and sell decisions. At Berkshire, we strive to be conservative 
              and consistent in our reserving. Even so, we warn you that an unpleasant 
              surprise is always possible. 
             �����The table that follows shows (at 
              intervals) the float generated by the various segments of Berkshire's 
              insurance operations since we entered the business 33 years ago 
              upon acquiring National Indemnity Company (whose traditional lines 
              are included in the segment "Other Primary"). For the table we have 
              calculated our float -- which we generate in large amounts relative 
              to our premium volume -- by adding net loss reserves, loss adjustment 
              reserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned premium 
              reserves, and then subtracting agents balances, prepaid acquisition 
              costs, prepaid taxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed 
              reinsurance. (Got that?)

�����Growth of float is important -- but 
              its cost is what's vital. Over the years we have usually recorded 
              only a small underwriting loss -- which means our cost of float 
              was correspondingly low -- or actually had an underwriting profit, 
              which means we were being paid for holding other people's 
              money. Indeed, our cumulative result through 1998 was an underwriting 
              profit. In 1999, however, we incurred a $1.4 billion underwriting 
              loss that left us with float cost of 5.8%. One mildly mitigating 
              factor: We enthusiastically welcomed $400 million of the loss because 
              it stems from business that will deliver us exceptional float over 
              the next decade. The balance of the loss, however, was decidedly 
              unwelcome, and our overall result must be judged extremely poor. 
              Absent a mega-catastrophe, we expect float cost to fall in 2000, 
              but any decline will be tempered by our aggressive plans for GEICO, 
              which we will discuss later. 
             ������There are a number of people 
              who deserve credit for manufacturing so much "no-cost" float over 
              the years. Foremost is Ajit Jain. It's simply impossible to overstate 
              Ajit's value to Berkshire: He has from scratch built an outstanding 
              reinsurance business, which during his tenure has earned an underwriting 
              profit and now holds $6.3 billion of float. 
             �����In Ajit, we have an underwriter 
              equipped with the intelligence to properly rate most risks; the 
              realism to forget about those he can't evaluate; the courage to 
              write huge policies when the premium is appropriate; and the discipline 
              to reject even the smallest risk when the premium is inadequate. 
              It is rare to find a person possessing any one of these talents. 
              For one person to have them all is remarkable. 
             �����Since Ajit specializes in super-cat 
              reinsurance, a line in which losses are infrequent but extremely 
              large when they occur, his business is sure to be far more volatile 
              than most insurance operations. To date, we have benefitted from 
              good luck on this volatile book. Even so, Ajit's achievements are 
              truly extraordinary. 
             �����In a smaller but nevertheless important 
              way, our "other primary" insurance operation has also added to Berkshire's 
              intrinsic value. This collection of insurers has delivered a $192 
              million underwriting profit over the past five years while supplying 
              us with the float shown in the table. In the insurance world, results 
              like this are uncommon, and for their feat we thank Rod Eldred, 
              Brad Kinstler, John Kizer, Don Towle and Don Wurster. 
             ������As I mentioned earlier, the 
              General Re operation had an exceptionally poor underwriting year 
              in 1999 (though investment income left the company well in the black). 
              Our business was extremely underpriced, both domestically and internationally, 
              a condition that is improving but not yet corrected. Over time, 
              however, the company should develop a growing amount of low-cost 
              float. At both General Re and its Cologne subsidiary, incentive 
              compensation plans are now directly tied to the variables of float 
              growth and cost of float, the same variables that determine value 
              for owners. 
             ������Even though a reinsurer may 
              have a tightly focused and rational compensation system, it cannot 
              count on every year coming up roses. Reinsurance is a highly volatile 
              business, and neither General Re nor Ajit's operation is immune 
              to bad pricing behavior in the industry. But General Re has the 
              distribution, the underwriting skills, the culture, and -- with 
              Berkshire's backing -- the financial clout to become the world's 
              most profitable reinsurance company. Getting there will take time, 
              energy and discipline, but we have no doubt that Ron Ferguson and 
              his crew can make it happen. 

GEICO (1-800-847-7536 or GEICO.com) 

 �����GEICO made exceptional progress 
              in 1999. The reasons are simple: We have a terrific business idea 
              being implemented by an extraordinary manager, Tony Nicely. When 
              Berkshire purchased GEICO at the beginning of 1996, we handed the 
              keys to Tony and asked him to run the operation exactly as if he 
              owned 100% of it. He has done the rest. Take a look at his scorecard:

�����In 1995, GEICO spent $33 million 
              on marketing and had 652 telephone counselors. Last year the company 
              spent $242 million, and the counselor count grew to 2,631. And we 
              are just starting: The pace will step up materially in 2000. Indeed, 
              we would happily commit $1 billion annually to marketing if we knew 
              we could handle the business smoothly and if we expected the last 
              dollar spent to produce new business at an attractive cost. 
             ������Currently two trends are affecting 
              acquisition costs. The bad news is that it has become more expensive 
              to develop inquiries. Media rates have risen, and we are also seeing 
              diminishing returns -- that is, as both we and our competitors step 
              up advertising, inquiries per ad fall for all of us. These negatives 
              are partly offset, however, by the fact that our closure ratio -- 
              the percentage of inquiries converted to sales -- has steadily improved. 
              Overall, we believe that our cost of new business, though definitely 
              rising, is well below that of the industry. Of even greater importance, 
              our operating costs for renewal business are the lowest among broad-based 
              national auto insurers. Both of these major competitive advantages 
              are sustainable. Others may copy our model, but 
              they will be unable to replicate our economics. 
             �����The table above makes it appear 
              that GEICO's retention of policyholders is falling, but for two 
              reasons appearances are in this case deceiving. First, in the last 
              few years our business mix has moved away from "preferred" policyholders, 
              for whom industrywide retention rates are high, toward "standard" 
              and "non-standard" policyholders for whom retention rates are much 
              lower. (Despite the nomenclature, the three classes have similar 
              profit prospects.) Second, retention rates for relatively new policyholders 
              are always lower than those for long-time customers -- and because 
              of our accelerated growth, our policyholder ranks now include an 
              increased proportion of new customers. Adjusted for these two factors, 
              our retention rate has changed hardly at all. 
             �����We told you last year that underwriting 
              margins for both GEICO and the industry would fall in 1999, and 
              they did. We make a similar prediction for 2000. A few years ago 
              margins got too wide, having enjoyed the effects of an unusual and 
              unexpected decrease in the frequency and severity of accidents. 
              The industry responded by reducing rates -- but now is having to 
              contend with an increase in loss costs. We would not be surprised 
              to see the margins of auto insurers deteriorate by around three 
              percentage points in 2000. 
             �����Two negatives besides worsening 
              frequency and severity will hurt the industry this year. First, 
              rate increases go into effect only slowly, both because of regulatory 
              delay and because insurance contracts must run their course before 
              new rates can be put in. Second, reported earnings of many auto 
              insurers have benefitted in the last few years from reserve releases, 
              made possible because the companies overestimated their loss costs 
              in still-earlier years. This reservoir of redundant reserves has 
              now largely dried up, and future boosts to earnings from this source 
              will be minor at best. 
             �����In compensating its associates -- 
              from Tony on down -- GEICO continues to use two variables, and only 
              two, in determining what bonuses and profit-sharing contributions 
              will be: 1) its percentage growth in policyholders and 2) the earnings 
              of its "seasoned" business, meaning policies that have been with 
              us for more than a year. We did outstandingly well on both fronts 
              during 1999 and therefore made a profit-sharing payment of 28.4% 
              of salary (in total, $113.3 million) to the great majority of our 
              associates. Tony and I love writing those checks. 
             �����At Berkshire, we want to have compensation 
              policies that are both easy to understand and in sync with what 
              we wish our associates to accomplish. Writing new business is expensive 
              (and, as mentioned, getting more expensive). If we were to include 
              those costs in our calculation of bonuses -- as managements did 
              before our arrival at GEICO -- we would be penalizing our associates 
              for garnering new policies, even though these are very much in Berkshire's 
              interest. So, in effect, we say to our associates that we will foot 
              the bill for new business. Indeed, because percentage growth in 
              policyholders is part of our compensation scheme, we reward 
              our associates for producing this initially-unprofitable business. 
              And then we reward them additionally for holding down costs on our 
              seasoned business. 
             �����Despite the extensive advertising 
              we do, our best source of new business is word-of-mouth recommendations 
              from existing policyholders, who on the whole are pleased with our 
              prices and service. An article published last year by Kiplinger's 
              Personal Finance Magazine gives a good picture of 
              where we stand in customer satisfaction: The magazine's survey of 
              20 state insurance departments showed that GEICO's complaint ratio 
              was well below the ratio for most of its major competitors. 
             �����Our strong referral business means 
              that we probably could maintain our policy count by spending as 
              little as $50 million annually on advertising. That's a guess, of 
              course, and we will never know whether it is accurate because Tony's 
              foot is going to stay on the advertising pedal (and my foot will 
              be on his). Nevertheless, I want to emphasize that a major percentage 
              of the $300-$350 million we will spend in 2000 on advertising, as 
              well as large additional costs we will incur for sales counselors, 
              communications and facilities, are optional outlays we choose to 
              make so that we can both achieve significant growth and extend and 
              solidify the promise of the GEICO brand in the minds of Americans. 
             �����Personally, I think these expenditures 
              are the best investment Berkshire can make. Through its advertising, 
              GEICO is acquiring a direct relationship with a huge number of households 
              that, on average, will send us $1,100 year after year. That makes 
              us -- among all companies, selling whatever kind of product -- one 
              of the country's leading direct merchandisers. Also, as we build 
              our long-term relationships with more and more families, cash is 
              pouring in rather than going out (no Internet economics here). Last 
              year, as GEICO increased its customer base by 766,256, it gained 
              $590 million of cash from operating earnings and the increase in 
              float. 
             �����In the past three years, we have 
              increased our market share in personal auto insurance from 2.7% 
              to 4.1%. But we rightfully belong in many more households -- maybe 
              even yours. Give us a call and find out. About 40% of those people 
              checking our rates find that they can save money by doing business 
              with us. The proportion is not 100% because insurers differ in their 
              underwriting judgments, with some giving more credit than we do 
              to drivers who live in certain geographic areas or work at certain 
              occupations. Our closure rate indicates, however, that we more frequently 
              offer the low price than does any other national carrier selling 
              insurance to all comers. Furthermore, in 40 states we can offer 
              a special discount -- usually 8% -- to our shareholders. Just be 
              sure to identify yourself as a Berkshire owner so that our sales 
              counselor can make the appropriate adjustment.

 �����It's with sadness that I report 
              to you that Lorimer Davidson, GEICO's former Chairman, died last 
              November, a few days after his 97th birthday. For GEICO, 
              Davy was a business giant who moved the company up to the big leagues. 
              For me, he was a friend, teacher and hero. I have told you of his 
              lifelong kindnesses to me in past reports. Clearly, my life would 
              have developed far differently had he not been a part of it. Tony, 
              Lou Simpson and I visited Davy in August and marveled at his mental 
              alertness -- particularly in all matters regarding GEICO. He was 
              the company's number one supporter right up to the end, and we will 
              forever miss him. 

Aviation Services 

 �����Our two aviation services companies 
              -- FlightSafety International ("FSI") and Executive Jet Aviation 
              ("EJA") -- are both runaway leaders in their field. EJA, which sells 
              and manages the fractional ownership of jet aircraft, through its 
              NetJets� program, is larger than its next two competitors combined. 
              FSI trains pilots (as well as other transportation professionals) 
              and is five times or so the size of its nearest competitor. 
             �����Another common characteristic of 
              the companies is that they are still managed by their founding entrepreneurs. 
              Al Ueltschi started FSI in 1951 with $10,000, and Rich Santulli 
              invented the fractional-ownership industry in 1986. These men are 
              both remarkable managers who have no financial need to work but 
              thrive on helping their companies grow and excel. 
             �����Though these two businesses have 
              leadership positions that are similar, they differ in their economic 
              characteristics. FSI must lay out huge amounts of capital. A single 
              flight simulator can cost as much as $15 million -- and we have 
              222. Only one person at a time, furthermore, can be trained in a 
              simulator, which means that the capital investment per dollar of 
              revenue at FSI is exceptionally high. Operating margins must therefore 
              also be high, if we are to earn a reasonable return on capital. 
              Last year we made capital expenditures of $215 million at FSI and 
              FlightSafety Boeing, its 50%-owned affiliate. 
             �����At EJA, in contrast, the customer 
              owns the equipment, though we, of course, must invest in a core 
              fleet of our own planes to ensure outstanding service. For example, 
              the Sunday after Thanksgiving, EJA's busiest day of the year, strains 
              our resources since fractions of 169 planes are owned by 1,412 customers, 
              many of whom are bent on flying home between 3 and 6 p.m. On that 
              day, and certain others, we need a supply of company-owned aircraft 
              to make sure all parties get where they want, when they want. 
             ������Still, most of the planes 
              we fly are owned by customers, which means that modest pre-tax margins 
              in this business can produce good returns on equity. Currently, 
              our customers own planes worth over $2 billion, and in addition 
              we have $4.2 billion of planes on order. Indeed, the limiting factor 
              in our business right now is the availability of planes. We now 
              are taking delivery of about 8% of all business jets manufactured 
              in the world, and we wish we could get a bigger share than that. 
              Though EJA was supply-constrained in 1999, its recurring revenues 
              -- monthly management fees plus hourly flight fees -- increased 
              46%. 
             ������The fractional-ownership industry 
              is still in its infancy. EJA is now building critical mass in Europe, 
              and over time we will expand around the world. Doing that will be 
              expensive -- very expensive -- but we will spend what it takes. 
              Scale is vital to both us and our customers: The company with the 
              most planes in the air worldwide will be able to offer its customers 
              the best service. "Buy a fraction, get a fleet" has real meaning 
              at EJA. 
             �����EJA enjoys another important advantage 
              in that its two largest competitors are both subsidiaries of aircraft 
              manufacturers and sell only the aircraft their parents make. Though 
              these are fine planes, these competitors are severely limited in 
              the cabin styles and mission capabilities they can offer. EJA, in 
              contrast, offers a wide array of planes from five suppliers. Consequently, 
              we can give the customer whatever he needs to buy -- rather 
              than his getting what the competitor's parent needs to sell. 
             �����Last year in this report, I described 
              my family's delight with the one-quarter (200 flight hours annually) 
              of a Hawker 1000 that we had owned since 1995. I got so pumped up 
              by my own prose that shortly thereafter I signed up for one-sixteenth 
              of a Cessna V Ultra as well. Now my annual outlays at EJA and Borsheim's, 
              combined, total ten times my salary. Think of this as a rough guideline 
              for your own expenditures with us. 
             �����During the past year, two of Berkshire's 
              outside directors have also signed on with EJA. (Maybe we're paying 
              them too much.) You should be aware that they and I are charged 
              exactly the same price for planes and service as is any other customer: 
              EJA follows a "most favored nations" policy, with no one getting 
              a special deal. 
             �����And now, brace yourself. Last year, 
              EJA passed the ultimate test: Charlie signed up. No other 
              endorsement could speak more eloquently to the value of the EJA 
              service. Give us a call at 1-800-848-6436 and ask for our "white 
              paper" on fractional ownership. 

Acquisitions of 1999 

 �����At both GEICO and Executive Jet, 
              our best source of new customers is the happy ones we already have. 
              Indeed, about 65% of our new owners of aircraft come as referrals 
              from current owners who have fallen in love with the service. 
             �����Our acquisitions usually develop 
              in the same way. At other companies, executives may devote themselves 
              to pursuing acquisition possibilities with investment bankers, utilizing 
              an auction process that has become standardized. In this exercise 
              the bankers prepare a "book" that makes me think of the Superman 
              comics of my youth. In the Wall Street version, a formerly mild-mannered 
              company emerges from the investment banker's phone booth able to 
              leap over competitors in a single bound and with earnings moving 
              faster than a speeding bullet. Titillated by the book's description 
              of the acquiree's powers, acquisition-hungry CEOs -- Lois Lanes 
              all, beneath their cool exteriors -- promptly swoon. 
             �����What's particularly entertaining 
              in these books is the precision with which earnings are projected 
              for many years ahead. If you ask the author-banker, however, what 
              his own firm will earn next month, he will go into a protective 
              crouch and tell you that business and markets are far too uncertain 
              for him to venture a forecast. 
             �����Here's one story I can't resist 
              relating: In 1985, a major investment banking house undertook to 
              sell Scott Fetzer, offering it widely -- but with no success. Upon 
              reading of this strikeout, I wrote Ralph Schey, then and now Scott 
              Fetzer's CEO, expressing an interest in buying the business. I had 
              never met Ralph, but within a week we had a deal. Unfortunately, 
              Scott Fetzer's letter of engagement with the banking firm provided 
              it a $2.5 million fee upon sale, even if it had nothing to do with 
              finding the buyer. I guess the lead banker felt he should do something 
              for his payment, so he graciously offered us a copy of the book 
              on Scott Fetzer that his firm had prepared. With his customary tact, 
              Charlie responded: "I'll pay $2.5 million not to read it." 
             �����At Berkshire, our carefully-crafted 
              acquisition strategy is simply to wait for the phone to ring. Happily, 
              it sometimes does so, usually because a manager who sold to us earlier 
              has recommended to a friend that he think about following suit. 
              

 �����Which brings us to the furniture 
              business. Two years ago I recounted how the acquisition of Nebraska 
              Furniture Mart in 1983 and my subsequent association with the Blumkin 
              family led to follow-on transactions with R. C. Willey (1995) and 
              Star Furniture (1997). For me, these relationships have all been 
              terrific. Not only did Berkshire acquire three outstanding retailers; 
              these deals also allowed me to become friends with some of the finest 
              people you will ever meet. 
             �����Naturally, I have persistently asked 
              the Blumkins, Bill Child and Melvyn Wolff whether there are any 
              more out there like you. Their invariable answer was the Tatelman 
              brothers of New England and their remarkable furniture business, 
              Jordan's. 
             �����I met Barry and Eliot Tatelman last 
              year and we soon signed an agreement for Berkshire to acquire the 
              company. Like our three previous furniture acquisitions, this business 
              had long been in the family -- in this case since 1927, when Barry 
              and Eliot's grandfather began operations in a Boston suburb. Under 
              the brothers' management, Jordan's has grown ever more dominant 
              in its region, becoming the largest furniture retailer in New Hampshire 
              as well as Massachusetts. 
             �����The Tatelmans don't just sell furniture 
              or manage stores. They also present customers with a dazzling entertainment 
              experience called "shoppertainment." A family visiting a store can 
              have a terrific time, while concurrently viewing an extraordinary 
              selection of merchandise. The business results are also extraordinary: 
              Jordan's has the highest sales per square foot of any major furniture 
              operation in the country. I urge you to visit one of their stores 
              if you are in the Boston area -- particularly the one at Natick, 
              which is Jordan's newest. Bring money. 
             �����Barry and Eliot are classy people 
              -- just like their counterparts at Berkshire's three other furniture 
              operations. When they sold to us, they elected to give each of their 
              employees at least 50� for every hour that he or she had worked for 
              Jordan's. This payment added up to $9 million, which came from the 
              Tatelmans' own pockets, not from Berkshire's. And Barry and Eliot 
              were thrilled to write the checks. 
             �����Each of our furniture operations 
              is number one in its territory. We now sell more furniture than 
              anyone else in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Texas, Nebraska, Utah 
              and Idaho. Last year Star's Melvyn Wolff and his sister, Shirley 
              Toomim, scored two major successes: a move into San Antonio and 
              a significant enlargement of Star's store in Austin. 
             �����There's no operation in the furniture 
              retailing business remotely like the one assembled by Berkshire. 
              It's fun for me and profitable for you. W. C. Fields once said, 
              "It was a woman who drove me to drink, but unfortunately I never 
              had the chance to thank her." I don't want to make that mistake. 
              My thanks go to Louie, Ron and Irv Blumkin for getting me started 
              in the furniture business and for unerringly guiding me as we have 
              assembled the group we now have. 



                * * * * * * * * * * * * 
              
 �����Now, for our second acquisition 
              deal: It came to us through my good friend, Walter Scott, Jr., chairman 
              of Level 3 Communications and a director of Berkshire. Walter has 
              many other business connections as well, and one of them is with 
              MidAmerican Energy, a utility company in which he has substantial 
              holdings and on whose board he sits. At a conference in California 
              that we both attended last September, Walter casually asked me whether 
              Berkshire might be interested in making a large investment in MidAmerican, 
              and from the start the idea of being in partnership with Walter 
              struck me as a good one. Upon returning to Omaha, I read some of 
              MidAmerican's public reports and had two short meetings with Walter 
              and David Sokol, MidAmerican's talented and entrepreneurial CEO. 
              I then said that, at an appropriate price, we would indeed like 
              to make a deal. 
             �����Acquisitions in the electric utility 
              industry are complicated by a variety of regulations including the 
              Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Therefore, we had to 
              structure a transaction that would avoid Berkshire gaining voting 
              control. Instead we are purchasing an 11% fixed-income security, 
              along with a combination of common stock and exchangeable preferred 
              that will give Berkshire just under 10% of the voting power of MidAmerican 
              but about 76% of the equity interest. All told, our investment will 
              be about $2 billion. 
             �����Walter characteristically backed 
              up his convictions with real money: He and his family will buy more 
              MidAmerican stock for cash when the transaction closes, bringing 
              their total investment to about $280 million. Walter will also be 
              the controlling shareholder of the company, and I can't think of 
              a better person to hold that post. 
             �����Though there are many regulatory 
              constraints in the utility industry, it's possible that we will 
              make additional commitments in the field. If we do, the amounts 
              involved could be large.
Acquisition Accounting 

 �����Once again, I would like to make 
              some comments about accounting, in this case about its application 
              to acquisitions. This is currently a very contentious topic and, 
              before the dust settles, Congress may even intervene (a truly terrible 
              idea). 
             �����When a company is acquired, generally 
              accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") currently condone two very 
              different ways of recording the transaction: "purchase" and "pooling." 
              In a pooling, stock must be the currency; in a purchase, payment 
              can be made in either cash or stock. Whatever the currency, managements 
              usually detest purchase accounting because it almost always requires 
              that a "goodwill" account be established and subsequently written 
              off -- a process that saddles earnings with a large annual charge 
              that normally persists for decades. In contrast, pooling avoids 
              a goodwill account, which is why managements love it. 
             �����Now, the Financial Accounting Standards 
              Board ("FASB") has proposed an end to pooling, and many CEOs are 
              girding for battle. It will be an important fight, so we'll venture 
              some opinions. To begin with, we agree with the many managers who 
              argue that goodwill amortization charges are usually spurious. You'll 
              find my thinking about this in the appendix to our 1983 annual report, 
              which is available on our website, and in the Owner's Manual on 
              pages 55 - 62. 
             �����For accounting rules to mandate 
              amortization that will, in the usual case, conflict with reality 
              is deeply troublesome: Most accounting charges relate to 
              what's going on, even if they don't precisely measure it. As an 
              example, depreciation charges can't with precision calibrate the 
              decline in value that physical assets suffer, but these charges 
              do at least describe something that is truly occurring: Physical 
              assets invariably deteriorate. Correspondingly, obsolescence charges 
              for inventories, bad debt charges for receivables and accruals for 
              warranties are among the charges that reflect true costs. The annual 
              charges for these expenses can't be exactly measured, but the necessity 
              for estimating them is obvious. 
             �����In contrast, economic goodwill does 
              not, in many cases, diminish. Indeed, in a great many instances 
              -- perhaps most -- it actually grows in value over time. In character, 
              economic goodwill is much like land: The value of both assets is 
              sure to fluctuate, but the direction in which value is going to 
              go is in no way ordained. At See's, for example, economic goodwill 
              has grown, in an irregular but very substantial manner, for 78 years. 
              And, if we run the business right, growth of that kind will probably 
              continue for at least another 78 years. 
             �����To escape from the fiction of goodwill 
              charges, managers embrace the fiction of pooling. This accounting 
              convention is grounded in the poetic notion that when two rivers 
              merge their streams become indistinguishable. Under this concept, 
              a company that has been merged into a larger enterprise has not 
              been "purchased" (even though it will often have received a large 
              "sell-out" premium). Consequently, no goodwill is created, and those 
              pesky subsequent charges to earnings are eliminated. Instead, the 
              accounting for the ongoing entity is handled as if the businesses 
              had forever been one unit. 
             �����So much for poetry. The reality 
              of merging is usually far different: There is indisputably an acquirer 
              and an acquiree, and the latter has been "purchased," no matter 
              how the deal has been structured. If you think otherwise, just ask 
              employees severed from their jobs which company was the conqueror 
              and which was the conquered. You will find no confusion. So on this 
              point the FASB is correct: In most mergers, a purchase has been 
              made. Yes, there are some true "mergers of equals," but they are 
              few and far between. 
             �����Charlie and I believe there's a 
              reality-based approach that should both satisfy the FASB, which 
              correctly wishes to record a purchase, and meet the objections of 
              managements to nonsensical charges for diminution of goodwill. We 
              would first have the acquiring company record its purchase price 
              -- whether paid in stock or cash -- at fair value. In most cases, 
              this procedure would create a large asset representing economic 
              goodwill. We would then leave this asset on the books, not requiring 
              its amortization. Later, if the economic goodwill became impaired, 
              as it sometimes would, it would be written down just as would any 
              other asset judged to be impaired. 
             �����If our proposed rule were to be 
              adopted, it should be applied retroactively so that acquisition 
              accounting would be consistent throughout America -- a far cry from 
              what exists today. One prediction: If this plan were to take effect, 
              managements would structure acquisitions more sensibly, deciding 
              whether to use cash or stock based on the real consequences for 
              their shareholders rather than on the unreal consequences for their 
              reported earnings. 



                * * * * * * * * * * * * 
              
 �����In our purchase of Jordan's, we 
              followed a procedure that will maximize the cash produced for our 
              shareholders but minimize the earnings we report to you. Berkshire 
              purchased assets for cash, an approach that on our tax returns permits 
              us to amortize the resulting goodwill over a 15-year period. Obviously, 
              this tax deduction materially increases the amount of cash delivered 
              by the business. In contrast, when stock, rather than assets, is 
              purchased for cash, the resulting writeoffs of goodwill are not 
              tax-deductible. The economic difference between these two approaches 
              is substantial. 
             �����From the economic standpoint of 
              the acquiring company, the worst deal of all is a stock-for-stock 
              acquisition. Here, a huge price is often paid without there being 
              any step-up in the tax basis of either the stock of the acquiree 
              or its assets. If the acquired entity is subsequently sold, its 
              owner may owe a large capital gains tax (at a 35% or greater rate), 
              even though the sale may truly be producing a major economic loss. 
             �����We have made some deals at Berkshire 
              that used far-from-optimal tax structures. These deals occurred 
              because the sellers insisted on a given structure and because, overall, 
              we still felt the acquisition made sense. We have never done an 
              inefficiently-structured deal, however, in order to make our figures 
              look better. 

Sources of Reported Earnings 

 �����The table that follows shows the 
              main sources of Berkshire's reported earnings. In this presentation, 
              purchase-accounting adjustments are not assigned to the specific 
              businesses to which they apply, but are instead aggregated and shown 
              separately. This procedure lets you view the earnings of our businesses 
              as they would have been reported had we not purchased them. For 
              the reasons discussed on page 61, this form of presentation seems 
              to us to be more useful to investors and managers than one utilizing 
              generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which require purchase-premiums 
              to be charged off business-by-business. The total earnings we show 
              in the table are, of course, identical to the GAAP total in our 
              audited financial statements.

 �����Almost all of our manufacturing, 
              retailing and service businesses had excellent results in 1999. 
              The exception was Dexter Shoe, and there the shortfall did not occur 
              because of managerial problems: In skills, energy and devotion to 
              their work, the Dexter executives are every bit the equal of our 
              other managers. But we manufacture shoes primarily in the U.S., 
              and it has become extremely difficult for domestic producers to 
              compete effectively. In 1999, approximately 93% of the 1.3 billion 
              pairs of shoes purchased in this country came from abroad, where 
              extremely low-cost labor is the rule.
 �����Counting both Dexter and H. H. Brown, 
              we are currently the leading domestic manufacturer of shoes, and 
              we are likely to continue to be. We have loyal, highly-skilled workers 
              in our U.S. plants, and we want to retain every job here that we 
              can. Nevertheless, in order to remain viable, we are sourcing more 
              of our output internationally. In doing that, we have incurred significant 
              severance and relocation costs that are included in the earnings 
              we show in the table. 
             �����A few years back, Helzberg's, our 
              200-store jewelry operation, needed to make operating adjustments 
              to restore margins to appropriate levels. Under Jeff Comment's leadership, 
              the job was done and profits have dramatically rebounded. In the 
              shoe business, where we have Harold Alfond, Peter Lunder, Frank 
              Rooney and Jim Issler in charge, I believe we will see a similar 
              improvement over the next few years. 
             �����See's Candies deserves a special 
              comment, given that it achieved a record operating margin of 24% 
              last year. Since we bought See's for $25 million in 1972, it has 
              earned $857 million pre-tax. And, despite its growth, the business 
              has required very little additional capital. Give the credit for 
              this performance to Chuck Huggins. Charlie and I put him in charge 
              the day of our purchase, and his fanatical insistence on both product 
              quality and friendly service has rewarded customers, employees and 
              owners. 
             �����Chuck gets better every year. When 
              he took charge of See's at age 46, the company's pre-tax profit, 
              expressed in millions, was about 10% of his age. Today he's 74, 
              and the ratio has increased to 100%. Having discovered this mathematical 
              relationship -- let's call it Huggins' Law -- Charlie and I now 
              become giddy at the mere thought of Chuck's birthday.

 �����Additional information about our 
              various businesses is given on pages 39 - 54, where you will also 
              find our segment earnings reported on a GAAP basis. In addition, 
              on pages 63 - 69, we have rearranged Berkshire's financial data 
              into four segments on a non-GAAP basis, a presentation that corresponds 
              to the way Charlie and I think about the company. 

Look-Through Earnings 

 �����Reported earnings are an inadequate 
              measure of economic progress at Berkshire, in part because the numbers 
              shown in the table presented earlier include only the dividends 
              we receive from investees -- though these dividends typically represent 
              only a small fraction of the earnings attributable to our ownership. 
              Not that we mind this division of money, since on balance we regard 
              the undistributed earnings of investees as more valuable to us than 
              the portion paid out. The reason for our thinking is simple: Our 
              investees often have the opportunity to reinvest earnings at high 
              rates of return. So why should we want them paid out? 
             �����To depict something closer to economic 
              reality at Berkshire than reported earnings, though, we employ the 
              concept of "look-through" earnings. As we calculate these, they 
              consist of: (1) the operating earnings reported in the previous 
              section, plus; (2) our share of the retained operating earnings 
              of major investees that, under GAAP accounting, are not reflected 
              in our profits, less; (3) an allowance for the tax that would be 
              paid by Berkshire if these retained earnings of investees had instead 
              been distributed to us. When tabulating "operating earnings" here, 
              we exclude purchase-accounting adjustments as well as capital gains 
              and other major non-recurring items. 
             �����The following table sets forth our 
              1999 look-through earnings, though I warn you that the figures can 
              be no more than approximate, since they are based on a number of 
              judgment calls. (The dividends paid to us by these investees have 
              been included in the operating earnings itemized on page 13, mostly 
              under "Insurance Group: Net Investment Income.")

 �����We made few portfolio changes in 
              1999. As I mentioned earlier, several of the companies in which 
              we have large investments had disappointing business results last 
              year. Nevertheless, we believe these companies have important competitive 
              advantages that will endure over time. This attribute, which makes 
              for good long-term investment results, is one Charlie and I occasionally 
              believe we can identify. More often, however, we can't -- not at 
              least with a high degree of conviction. This explains, by the way, 
              why we don't own stocks of tech companies, even though we share 
              the general view that our society will be transformed by their products 
              and services. Our problem -- which we can't solve by studying up 
              -- is that we have no insights into which participants in the tech 
              field possess a truly durable competitive advantage. 
             �����Our lack of tech insights, we should 
              add, does not distress us. After all, there are a great many business 
              areas in which Charlie and I have no special capital-allocation 
              expertise. For instance, we bring nothing to the table when it comes 
              to evaluating patents, manufacturing processes or geological prospects. 
              So we simply don't get into judgments in those fields. 

 �����If we have a strength, it is in 
              recognizing when we are operating well within our circle of competence 
              and when we are approaching the perimeter. Predicting the long-term 
              economics of companies that operate in fast-changing industries 
              is simply far beyond our perimeter. If others claim predictive skill 
              in those industries -- and seem to have their claims validated by 
              the behavior of the stock market -- we neither envy nor emulate 
              them. Instead, we just stick with what we understand. If we stray, 
              we will have done so inadvertently, not because we got restless 
              and substituted hope for rationality. Fortunately, it's almost certain 
              there will be opportunities from time to time for Berkshire to do 
              well within the circle we've staked out. 
             �����Right now, the prices of the fine 
              businesses we already own are just not that attractive. In other 
              words, we feel much better about the businesses than their stocks. 
              That's why we haven't added to our present holdings. Nevertheless, 
              we haven't yet scaled back our portfolio in a major way: If the 
              choice is between a questionable business at a comfortable price 
              or a comfortable business at a questionable price, we much prefer 
              the latter. What really gets our attention, however, is a comfortable 
              business at a comfortable price. 
             �����Our reservations about the prices 
              of securities we own apply also to the general level of equity prices. 
              We have never attempted to forecast what the stock market is going 
              to do in the next month or the next year, and we are not trying 
              to do that now. But, as I point out in the enclosed article, equity 
              investors currently seem wildly optimistic in their expectations 
              about future returns. 
             �����We see the growth in corporate profits 
              as being largely tied to the business done in the country (GDP), 
              and we see GDP growing at a real rate of about 3%. In addition, 
              we have hypothesized 2% inflation. Charlie and I have no particular 
              conviction about the accuracy of 2%. However, it's the market's 
              view: Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) yield about 
              two percentage points less than the standard treasury bond, and 
              if you believe inflation rates are going to be higher than that, 
              you can profit by simply buying TIPS and shorting Governments. 
             �����If profits do indeed grow along 
              with GDP, at about a 5% rate, the valuation placed on American business 
              is unlikely to climb by much more than that. Add in something for 
              dividends, and you emerge with returns from equities that are dramatically 
              less than most investors have either experienced in the past or 
              expect in the future. If investor expectations become more realistic 
              -- and they almost certainly will -- the market adjustment is apt 
              to be severe, particularly in sectors in which speculation has been 
              concentrated. 
             �����Berkshire will someday have opportunities 
              to deploy major amounts of cash in equity markets -- we are confident 
              of that. But, as the song goes, "Who knows where or when?" Meanwhile, 
              if anyone starts explaining to you what is going on in the truly-manic 
              portions of this "enchanted" market, you might remember still another 
              line of song: "Fools give you reasons, wise men never try." 

Share Repurchases 

 �����Recently, a number of shareholders 
              have suggested to us that Berkshire repurchase its shares. Usually 
              the requests were rationally based, but a few leaned on spurious 
              logic. 
             �����There is only one combination of 
              facts that makes it advisable for a company to repurchase its shares: 
              First, the company has available funds -- cash plus sensible borrowing 
              capacity -- beyond the near-term needs of the business and, second, 
              finds its stock selling in the market below its intrinsic value, 
              conservatively-calculated. To this we add a caveat: Shareholders 
              should have been supplied all the information they need for estimating 
              that value. Otherwise, insiders could take advantage of their uninformed 
              partners and buy out their interests at a fraction of true worth. 
              We have, on rare occasions, seen that happen. Usually, of course, 
              chicanery is employed to drive stock prices up, not down. 
             �����The business "needs" that I speak 
              of are of two kinds: First, expenditures that a company must make 
              to maintain its competitive position (e.g., the remodeling of stores 
              at Helzberg's) and, second, optional outlays, aimed at business 
              growth, that management expects will produce more than a dollar 
              of value for each dollar spent (R. C. Willey's expansion into Idaho). 
             �����When available funds exceed needs 
              of those kinds, a company with a growth-oriented shareholder population 
              can buy new businesses or repurchase shares. If a company's stock 
              is selling well below intrinsic value, repurchases usually make 
              the most sense. In the mid-1970s, the wisdom of making these was 
              virtually screaming at managements, but few responded. In most cases, 
              those that did made their owners much wealthier than if alternative 
              courses of action had been pursued. Indeed, during the 1970s (and, spasmodically, for some years 
          thereafter) we searched for companies that were large repurchasers of 
          their shares. This often was a tipoff that the company was both undervalued 
          and run by a shareholder-oriented management. 
             �����That day is past. Now, repurchases 
              are all the rage, but are all too often made for an unstated and, 
              in our view, ignoble reason: to pump or support the stock price. 
              The shareholder who chooses to sell today, of course, is benefitted 
              by any buyer, whatever his origin or motives. But the continuing 
              shareholder is penalized by repurchases above intrinsic value. Buying 
              dollar bills for $1.10 is not good business for those who stick 
              around. 
             �����Charlie and I admit that we feel 
              confident in estimating intrinsic value for only a portion of traded 
              equities and then only when we employ a range of values, rather 
              than some pseudo-precise figure. Nevertheless, it appears to us 
              that many companies now making repurchases are overpaying departing 
              shareholders at the expense of those who stay. In defense of those 
              companies, I would say that it is natural for CEOs to be optimistic 
              about their own businesses. They also know a whole lot more about 
              them than I do. However, I can't help but feel that too often today's 
              repurchases are dictated by management's desire to "show confidence" 
              or be in fashion rather than by a desire to enhance per-share value. 
             �����Sometimes, too, companies say they 
              are repurchasing shares to offset the shares issued when stock options 
              granted at much lower prices are exercised. This "buy high, sell 
              low" strategy is one many unfortunate investors have employed -- 
              but never intentionally! Managements, however, seem to follow this 
              perverse activity very cheerfully. 
             �����Of course, both option grants and 
              repurchases may make sense -- but if that's the case, it's not because 
              the two activities are logically related. Rationally, a company's 
              decision to repurchase shares or to issue them should stand on its 
              own feet. Just because stock has been issued to satisfy options 
              -- or for any other reason -- does not mean that stock should be 
              repurchased at a price above intrinsic value. Correspondingly, a 
              stock that sells well below intrinsic value should be repurchased 
              whether or not stock has previously been issued (or may be because 
              of outstanding options). 
             �����You should be aware that, at certain 
              times in the past, I have erred in not making repurchases. 
              My appraisal of Berkshire's value was then too conservative or I 
              was too enthused about some alternative use of funds. We have therefore 
              missed some opportunities -- though Berkshire's trading volume at 
              these points was too light for us to have done much buying, which 
              means that the gain in our per-share value would have been minimal. 
              (A repurchase of, say, 2% of a company's shares at a 25% discount 
              from per-share intrinsic value produces only a �% gain in that value 
              at most -- and even less if the funds could alternatively have been 
              deployed in value-building moves.) 
             �����Some of the letters we've received 
              clearly imply that the writer is unconcerned about intrinsic value 
              considerations but instead wants us to trumpet an intention to repurchase 
              so that the stock will rise (or quit going down). If the writer 
              wants to sell tomorrow, his thinking makes sense -- for him! -- 
              but if he intends to hold, he should instead hope the stock falls 
              and trades in enough volume for us to buy a lot of it. That's the 
              only way a repurchase program can have any real benefit for a continuing 
              shareholder. 
             �����We will not repurchase shares unless 
              we believe Berkshire stock is selling well below intrinsic value, 
              conservatively calculated. Nor will we attempt to talk the stock 
              up or down. (Neither publicly or privately have I ever told anyone 
              to buy or sell Berkshire shares.) Instead we will give all shareholders 
              -- and potential shareholders -- the same valuation-related information 
              we would wish to have if our positions were reversed. 
             �����Recently, when the A shares fell 
              below $45,000, we considered making repurchases. We decided, however, 
              to delay buying, if indeed we elect to do any, until shareholders 
              have had the chance to review this report. If we do find that repurchases 
              make sense, we will only rarely place bids on the New York Stock 
              Exchange ("NYSE"). Instead, we will respond to offers made directly 
              to us at or below the NYSE bid. If you wish to offer stock, have 
              your broker call Mark Millard at 402-346-1400. When a trade occurs, 
              the broker can either record it in the "third market" or on the 
              NYSE. We will favor purchase of the B shares if they are selling 
              at more than a 2% discount to the A. We will not engage in transactions 
              involving fewer than 10 shares of A or 50 shares of B. 
             �����Please be clear about one point: 
              We will never make purchases with the intention of stemming 
              a decline in Berkshire's price. Rather we will make them if and 
              when we believe that they represent an attractive use of the Company's 
              money. At best, repurchases are likely to have only a very minor 
              effect on the future rate of gain in our stock's intrinsic value. 
            Shareholder-Designated Contributions

 �����About 97.3% of all eligible shares 
              participated in Berkshire's 1999 shareholder-designated contributions 
              program, with contributions totaling $17.2 million. A full description 
              of the program appears on pages 70 - 71. 
             �����Cumulatively, over the 19 years 
              of the program, Berkshire has made contributions of $147 million 
              pursuant to the instructions of our shareholders. The rest of Berkshire's 
              giving is done by our subsidiaries, which stick to the philanthropic 
              patterns that prevailed before they were acquired (except that their 
              former owners themselves take on the responsibility for their personal 
              charities). In aggregate, our subsidiaries made contributions of 
              $13.8 million in 1999, including in-kind donations of $2.5 million. 
            �����To participate in future programs, 
              you must own Class A shares that are registered in the name of the 
              actual owner, not the nominee name of a broker, bank or depository. 
              Shares not so registered on August 31, 2000, will be ineligible 
              for the 2000 program. When you get the contributions form from us, 
              return it promptly so that it does not get put aside or forgotten. 
              Designations received after the due date will not be honored.


The Annual Meeting 

 �����This year's Woodstock 
              Weekend for Capitalists will follow a format slightly different 
              from that of recent years. We need to make a change because the 
              Aksarben Coliseum, which served us well the past three years, is 
              gradually being closed down. Therefore, we are relocating to the 
              Civic Auditorium (which is on Capitol Avenue between 18th 
              and 19th, behind the Doubletree Hotel), the only other 
              facility in Omaha offering the space we require. 
             �����The Civic, however, is located in 
              downtown Omaha, and we would create a parking and traffic nightmare 
              if we were to meet there on a weekday. We will, therefore, convene 
              on Saturday, April 29, with the doors opening at 7 a.m., the movie 
              beginning at 8:30 and the meeting itself commencing at 9:30. As 
              in the past, we will run until 3:30 with a short break at noon for 
              food, which will be available at the Civic's concession stands. 
             �����An attachment to the proxy material 
              that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the 
              credential you will need for admission to the meeting and other 
              events. As for plane, hotel and car reservations, we have again 
              signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. 
              In our normal fashion, we will run buses from the larger hotels 
              to the meeting. After the meeting, the buses will make trips back 
              to the hotels and to Nebraska Furniture Mart, Borsheim's and the 
              airport. Even so, you are likely to find a car useful. 
             �����We have scheduled the meeting in 
              2002 and 2003 on the customary first Saturday in May. In 2001, however, 
              the Civic is already booked on that Saturday, so we will meet on 
              April 28. The Civic should fit our needs well on any weekend, since 
              there will then be more than ample parking in nearby lots and garages 
              as well as on streets. We will also be able to greatly enlarge the 
              space we give exhibitors. So, overcoming my normal commercial reticence, 
              I will see that you have a wide display of Berkshire products at 
              the Civic that you can purchase. As a benchmark, in 1999 
              shareholders bought 3,059 pounds of See's candy, $16,155 of World 
              Book Products, 1,928 pairs of Dexter shoes, 895 sets of Quikut knives, 
              1,752 golf balls with the Berkshire Hathaway logo and 3,446 items 
              of Berkshire apparel. I know you can do better. 
             �����Last year, we also initiated the 
              sale of at least eight fractions of Executive Jet aircraft. We will 
              again have an array of models at the Omaha airport for your inspection 
              on Saturday and Sunday. Ask an EJA representative at the Civic about 
              viewing any of these planes. 
             �����Dairy Queen will also be on hand 
              at the Civic and again will donate all proceeds to the Children's 
              Miracle Network. Last year we sold 4,586 Dilly� bars, fudge 
              bars and vanilla/orange bars. Additionally, GEICO will have a booth 
              that will be staffed by a number of our top counselors from around 
              the country, all of them ready to supply you with auto insurance 
              quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to offer you a special 
              shareholder's discount. Bring the details of your existing insurance, 
              and check out whether we can save you some money. 
             �����Finally, Ajit Jain and his associates 
              will be on hand to offer both no-commission annuities and a liability 
              policy with jumbo limits of a size rarely available elsewhere. Talk 
              to Ajit and learn how to protect yourself and your family against 
              a $10 million judgment. 
             �����NFM's newly remodeled complex, located 
              on a 75-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, 
              is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
              on Saturdays and Sundays. This operation offers an unrivaled breadth 
              of merchandise -- furniture, electronics, appliances, carpets and 
              computers -- all at can't-be-beat prices. In 1999 NFM did more than 
              $300 million of business at its 72nd Street location, 
              which in a metropolitan area of 675,000 is an absolute miracle. 
              During the Thursday, April 27 to Monday, May 1 period, any shareholder 
              presenting his or her meeting credential will receive a discount 
              that is customarily given only to employees. We have offered this 
              break to shareholders the last couple of years, and sales have been 
              amazing. In last year's five-day "Berkshire Weekend," NFM's volume 
              was $7.98 million, an increase of 26% from 1998 and 51% from 1997. 
             �����Borsheim's -- the largest jewelry 
              store in the country except for Tiffany's Manhattan store -- will 
              have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a champagne 
              and dessert party from 6 p.m.-10 p.m. on Friday, April 28. The second, 
              the main gala, will be from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday, April 30. 
              On that day, Charlie and I will be on hand to sign sales tickets. 
              Shareholder prices will be available Thursday through Monday, so 
              if you wish to avoid the largest crowds, which will form on Friday 
              evening and Sunday, come at other times and identify yourself as 
              a shareholder. On Saturday, we will be open until 7 p.m. Borsheim's 
              operates on a gross margin that is fully twenty percentage points 
              below that of its major rivals, so be prepared to be blown away 
              by both our prices and selection. 
             �����In the mall outside of Borsheim's, 
              we will again have Bob Hamman -- the best bridge player the game 
              has ever seen -- available to play with our shareholders on Sunday. 
              We will also have a few other experts playing at additional tables. 
              In 1999, we had more demand than tables, but we will cure that problem 
              this year. 
             �����Patrick Wolff, twice US chess champion, 
              will again be in the mall playing blindfolded against all comers. 
              He tells me that he has never tried to play more than four games 
              simultaneously while handicapped this way but might try to bump 
              that limit to five or six this year. If you're a chess fan, take 
              Patrick on -- but be sure to check his blindfold before your first 
              move. 
             �����Gorat's -- my favorite steakhouse 
              -- will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on 
              Sunday, April 30, and will be serving from 4 p.m. until about midnight. 
              Please remember that you can't come to Gorat's on Sunday without 
              a reservation. To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 3 (but 
              not before). If Sunday is sold out, try Gorat's on one of the 
              other evenings you will be in town. I make a "quality check" of 
              Gorat's about once a week and can report that their rare T-bone 
              (with a double order of hash browns) is still unequaled throughout 
              the country. 
             �����The usual baseball game will be 
              held at Rosenblatt Stadium at 7 p.m. on Saturday night. This year 
              the Omaha Golden Spikes will play the Iowa Cubs. Come early, because 
              that's when the real action takes place. Those who attended last 
              year saw your Chairman pitch to Ernie Banks. 
             �����This encounter proved to be the 
              titanic duel that the sports world had long awaited. After the first 
              few pitches -- which were not my best, but when have I ever thrown 
              my best? -- I fired a brushback at Ernie just to let him know who 
              was in command. Ernie charged the mound, and I charged the plate. 
              But a clash was avoided because we became exhausted before reaching 
              each other. 
             �����Ernie was dissatisfied with his 
              performance last year and has been studying the game films all winter. 
              As you may know, Ernie had 512 home runs in his career as a Cub. 
              Now that he has spotted telltale weaknesses in my delivery, he expects 
              to get #513 on April 29. I, however, have learned new ways to disguise 
              my "flutterball." Come and watch this matchup. 
             �����I should add that I have extracted 
              a promise from Ernie that he will not hit a "come-backer" at me 
              since I would never be able to duck in time to avoid it. My reflexes 
              are like Woody Allen's, who said his were so slow that he was once 
              hit by a car being pushed by two guys. 
             �����Our proxy statement contains instructions 
              about obtaining tickets to the game and also a large quantity of 
              other information that should help you enjoy your visit in Omaha. 
              Join us at the Capitalist Caper on Capitol Avenue.

Notes:
Data are for calendar years with these exceptions:  1965 and 1966, year ended 9/30; 1967, 15 months ended 12/31.
Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previously the requirement.  In this table, Berkshire's results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules.  In all other respects, the results are calculated using the numbers originally reported.
The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax.  If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P in years when the index showed a negative return.  Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.


BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.

To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:

�����Our gain in net worth during 2000 was $3.96 billion, which increased the per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stock by 6.5%.  Over the last 36 years (that is, since present management took over) per-share book value has grown from $19 to $40,442, a gain of 23.6% compounded annually.*


*�����All figures used in this report apply 
          to Berkshire's A shares, the successor to the only stock that the company 
          had outstanding before 1996. The B shares have an economic interest 
          equal to 1/30th that of the A. 
       	

�����Overall, we had a decent year, our book-value gain having outpaced the performance of the S&P 500.  And, though this judgment is necessarily subjective, we believe Berkshire�s gain in per-share intrinsic value moderately exceeded its gain in book value.  (Intrinsic value, as well as other key investment and accounting terms and concepts, are explained in our Owner�s Manual on pages 59-66.  Intrinsic value is discussed on page 64.)
�����Furthermore, we completed two significant acquisitions that we negotiated in 1999 and initiated six more.  All told, these purchases have cost us about $8 billion, with 97% of that amount paid in cash and 3% in stock.  The eight businesses we�ve acquired have aggregate sales of about $13 billion and employ 58,000 people.  Still, we incurred no debt in making these purchases, and our shares outstanding have increased only 1/3 of 1%.  Better yet, we remain awash in liquid assets and are both eager and ready for even larger acquisitions.
�����I will detail our purchases in the next section of the report.  But I will tell you now that we have embraced the 21st century by entering such cutting-edge industries as brick, carpet, insulation and paint.  Try to control your excitement.
�����On the minus side, policyholder growth at GEICO slowed to a halt as the year progressed.  It has become much more expensive to obtain new business.  I told you last year that we would get our money�s worth from stepped-up advertising at GEICO in 2000, but I was wrong.  We�ll examine the reasons later in the report.
�����Another negative � which has persisted for several years � is that we see our equity portfolio as only mildly attractive.  We own stocks of some excellent businesses, but most of our holdings are fully priced and are unlikely to deliver more than moderate returns in the future.  We�re not alone in facing this problem:  The long-term prospect for equities in general is far from exciting. 
�����Finally, there is the negative that recurs annually:  Charlie Munger, Berkshire�s Vice Chairman and my partner, and I are a year older than when we last reported to you.  Mitigating this adverse development is the indisputable fact that the age of your top managers is increasing at a considerably lower rate � percentage-wise � than is the case at almost all other major corporations.  Better yet, this differential will widen in the future.
�����Charlie and I continue to aim at increasing Berkshire�s per-share value at a rate that, over time, will modestly exceed the gain from owning the S&P 500.  As the table on the facing page shows, a small annual advantage in our favor can, if sustained, produce an anything-but-small long-term advantage.  To reach our goal we will need to add a few good businesses to Berkshire�s stable each year, have the businesses we own generally gain in value, and avoid any material increase in our outstanding shares.  We are confident about meeting the last two objectives; the first will require some luck.
�����It�s appropriate here to thank two groups that made my job both easy and fun last year � just as they do every year.  First, our operating managers continue to run their businesses in splendid fashion, which allows me to spend my time allocating capital rather than supervising them.  (I wouldn�t be good at that anyway.)
�����Our managers are a very special breed.  At most large companies, the truly talented divisional managers seldom have the job they really want.  Instead they yearn to become CEOs, either at their present employer or elsewhere.  Indeed, if they stay put, they and their colleagues are likely to feel they have failed.
�����At Berkshire, our all-stars have exactly the jobs they want, ones that they hope and expect to keep throughout their business lifetimes.  They therefore concentrate solely on maximizing the long-term value of the businesses that they "own" and love.  If the businesses succeed, they have succeeded.  And they stick with us:  In our last 36 years, Berkshire has never had a manager of a significant subsidiary voluntarily leave to join another business.
�����The other group to which I owe enormous thanks is the home-office staff.  After the eight acquisitions more than doubled our worldwide workforce to about 112,000, Charlie and I went soft last year and added one more person at headquarters.  (Charlie, bless him, never lets me forget Ben Franklin�s advice: "A small leak can sink a great ship.")  Now we have 13.8 people.
�����This tiny band works miracles.  In 2000 it handled all of the details connected with our eight acquisitions, processed extensive regulatory and tax filings (our tax return covers 4,896 pages), smoothly produced an annual meeting to which 25,000 tickets were issued, and accurately dispensed checks to 3,660 charities designated by our shareholders.  In addition, the group dealt with all the routine tasks served up by a company with a revenue run-rate of $40 billion and more than 300,000 owners.   And, to add to all of this, the other 12.8 are a delight to be around.
�����I should pay to have my job.

Acquisitions of 2000
�����Our acquisition technique at Berkshire is simplicity itself: We answer the phone.  I�m also glad to report that it rings a bit more often now, because owners and/or managers increasingly wish to join their companies with Berkshire.  Our acquisition criteria are set forth on page 23, and the number to call is 402-346-1400.
�����Let me tell you a bit about the businesses we have purchased during the past 14 months, starting with the two transactions that were initiated in 1999, but closed in 2000.  (This list excludes some smaller purchases that were made by the managers of our subsidiaries and that, in most cases, will be integrated into their operations.)


I described the first purchase � 76% of MidAmerican Energy � in last year�s report.  Because of regulatory constraints on our voting privileges, we perform only a "one-line" consolidation of MidAmerican�s earnings and equity in our financial statements.  If we instead fully consolidated the company�s figures, our revenues in 2000 would have been $5 billion greater than we reported, though net income would remain the same.

On November 23, 1999, I received a one-page fax from Bruce Cort that appended a Washington Post article describing an aborted buyout of CORT Business Services.  Despite his name, Bruce has no connection with CORT.  Rather, he is an airplane broker who had sold Berkshire a jet in 1986 and who, before the fax, had not been in touch with me for about ten years.
I knew nothing about CORT, but I immediately printed out its SEC filings and liked what I saw.  That same day I told Bruce I had a possible interest and asked him to arrange a meeting with Paul Arnold, CORT�s CEO.  Paul and I got together on November 29, and I knew at once that we had the right ingredients for a purchase: a fine though unglamorous business, an outstanding manager, and a price (going by that on the failed deal) that made sense.
Operating out of 117 showrooms, CORT is the national leader in "rent-to-rent" furniture, primarily used in offices but also by temporary occupants of apartments.  This business, it should be noted, has no similarity to "rent-to-own" operations, which usually involve the sale of home furnishings and electronics to people having limited income and poor credit.
We quickly purchased CORT for Wesco, our 80%-owned subsidiary, paying about $386 million in cash.  You will find more details about CORT�s operations in Wesco�s 1999 and 2000 annual reports.  Both Charlie and I enjoy working with Paul, and CORT looks like a good bet to beat our original expectations.

Early last year, Ron Ferguson of General Re put me in contact with Bob Berry, whose family had owned U.S. Liability for 49 years.  This insurer, along with two sister companies, is a medium-sized, highly-respected writer of unusual risks � "excess and surplus lines" in insurance jargon.  After Bob and I got in touch, we agreed by phone on a half-stock, half-cash deal.
In recent years, Tom Nerney has managed the operation for the Berry family and has achieved a rare combination of excellent growth and unusual profitability.  Tom is a powerhouse in other ways as well.  In addition to having four adopted children (two from Russia), he has an extended family: the Philadelphia Belles, a young-teen girls basketball team that Tom coaches.  The team had a 62-4 record last year and finished second in the AAU national tournament.
Few property-casualty companies are outstanding businesses.  We have far more than our share, and U.S. Liability adds luster to the collection.

Ben Bridge Jeweler was another purchase we made by phone, prior to any face-to-face meeting between me and the management.  Ed Bridge, who with his cousin, Jon, manages this 65-store West Coast retailer, is a friend of Barnett Helzberg, from whom we bought Helzberg Diamonds in 1995.  Upon learning that the Bridge family proposed to sell its company, Barnett gave Berkshire a strong recommendation.  Ed then called and explained his business to me, also sending some figures, and we made a deal, again half for cash and half for stock.
Ed and Jon are fourth generation owner-managers of a business started 89 years ago in Seattle.  Both the business and the family � including Herb and Bob, the fathers of Jon and Ed � enjoy extraordinary reputations.  Same-store sales have increased by 9%, 11%, 13%, 10%, 12%, 21% and 7% over the past seven years, a truly remarkable record.
It was vital to the family that the company operate in the future as in the past.  No one wanted another jewelry chain to come in and decimate the organization with ideas about synergy and cost saving (which, though they would never work, were certain to be tried).  I told Ed and Jon that they would be in charge, and they knew I could be believed:  After all, it�s obvious that your Chairman would be a disaster at actually running a store or selling jewelry (though there are members of his family who have earned black belts as purchasers).
In their typically classy way, the Bridges allocated a substantial portion of the proceeds from their sale to the hundreds of co-workers who had helped the company achieve its success.  We�re proud to be associated with both the family and the company.

In July we acquired Justin Industries, the leading maker of Western boots � including the Justin, Tony Lama, Nocona, and Chippewa brands � and the premier producer of brick in Texas and five neighboring states.
Here again, our acquisition involved serendipity.  On May 4th, I received a fax from Mark Jones, a stranger to me, proposing that Berkshire join a group to acquire an unnamed company.  I faxed him back, explaining that with rare exceptions we don�t invest with others, but would happily pay him a commission if he sent details and we later made a purchase.  He replied that the "mystery company" was Justin.  I then went to Fort Worth to meet John Roach, chairman of the company and John Justin, who had built the business and was its major shareholder.  Soon after, we bought Justin for $570 million in cash.
John Justin loved Justin Industries but had been forced to retire because of severe health problems (which sadly led to his death in late February).  John was a class act � as a citizen, businessman and human being.  Fortunately, he had groomed two outstanding managers, Harrold Melton at Acme and Randy Watson at Justin Boot, each of whom runs his company autonomously.
Acme, the larger of the two operations, produces more than one billion bricks per year at its 22 plants, about 11.7% of the industry�s national output.  The brick business, however, is necessarily regional, and in its territory Acme enjoys unquestioned leadership. When Texans are asked to name a brand of brick, 75% respond Acme, compared to 16% for the runner-up.  (Before our purchase, I couldn�t have named a brand of brick.  Could you have?)  This brand recognition is not only due to Acme�s product quality, but also reflects many decades of extraordinary community service by both the company and John Justin.
I can�t resist pointing out that Berkshire � whose top management has long been mired in the 19th century � is now one of the very few authentic "clicks-and-bricks" businesses around.  We went into 2000 with GEICO doing significant business on the Internet, and then we added Acme.  You can bet this move by Berkshire is making them sweat in Silicon Valley.

In June, Bob Shaw, CEO of Shaw Industries, the world�s largest carpet manufacturer, came to see me with his partner, Julian Saul, and the CEO of a second company with which Shaw was mulling a merger.  The potential partner, however, faced huge asbestos liabilities from past activities, and any deal depended on these being eliminated through insurance.
The executives visiting me wanted Berkshire to provide a policy that would pay all future asbestos costs.  I explained that though we could write an exceptionally large policy � far larger than any other insurer would ever think of offering � we would never issue a policy that lacked a cap.
Bob and Julian decided that if we didn�t want to bet the ranch on the extent of the acquiree�s liability, neither did they.  So their deal died.  But my interest in Shaw was sparked, and a few months later Charlie and I met with Bob to work out a purchase by Berkshire.  A key feature of the deal was that both Bob and Julian were to continue owning at least 5% of Shaw.  This leaves us associated with the best in the business as shown by Bob and Julian�s record: Each built a large, successful carpet business before joining forces in 1998.
Shaw has annual sales of about $4 billion, and we own 87.3% of the company.  Leaving aside our insurance operation, Shaw is by far our largest business.  Now, if people walk all over us, we won�t mind.

In July, Bob Mundheim, a director of Benjamin Moore Paint, called to ask if Berkshire might be interested in acquiring it.  I knew Bob from Salomon, where he was general counsel during some difficult times, and held him in very high regard.  So my answer was "Tell me more."
In late August, Charlie and I met with Richard Roob and Yvan Dupuy, past and present CEOs of Benjamin Moore.  We liked them; we liked the business; and we made a $1 billion cash offer on the spot.  In October, their board approved the transaction, and we completed it in December.  Benjamin Moore has been making paint for 117 years and has thousands of independent dealers that are a vital asset to its business.  Make sure you specify our product for your next paint job.

Finally, in late December, we agreed to buy Johns Manville Corp. for about $1.8 billion.  This company�s incredible odyssey over the last few decades � too multifaceted to be chronicled here � was shaped by its long history as a manufacturer of asbestos products.  The much-publicized health problems that affected many people exposed to asbestos led to JM�s declaring bankruptcy in 1982.
Subsequently, the bankruptcy court established a trust for victims, the major asset of which was a controlling interest in JM.  The trust, which sensibly wanted to diversify its assets, agreed last June to sell the business to an LBO buyer.  In the end, though, the LBO group was unable to obtain financing.

Consequently, the deal was called off on Friday, December 8th.  The following Monday, Charlie and I called Bob Felise, chairman of the trust, and made an all-cash offer with no financing contingencies.  The next day the trustees voted tentatively to accept our offer, and a week later we signed a contract.
JM is the nation�s leading producer of commercial and industrial insulation and also has major positions in roofing systems and a variety of engineered products.  The company�s sales exceed $2 billion and the business has earned good, if cyclical, returns.  Jerry Henry, JM�s CEO, had announced his retirement plans a year ago, but I�m happy to report that Charlie and I have convinced him to stick around.

�����Two economic factors probably contributed to the rush of acquisition activity we experienced last year.  First, many managers and owners foresaw near-term slowdowns in their businesses � and, in fact, we purchased several companies whose earnings will almost certainly decline this year from peaks they reached in 1999 or 2000.  The declines make no difference to us, given that we expect all of our businesses to now and then have ups and downs.  (Only in the sales presentations of investment banks do earnings move forever upward.)  We don�t care about the bumps; what matters are the overall results.  But the decisions of other people are sometimes affected by the near-term outlook, which can both spur sellers and temper the enthusiasm of purchasers who might otherwise compete with us.
�����A second factor that helped us in 2000 was that the market for junk bonds dried up as the year progressed.  In the two preceding years, junk bond purchasers had relaxed their standards, buying the obligations of ever-weaker issuers at inappropriate prices.  The effects of this laxity were felt last year in a ballooning of defaults.  In this environment, "financial" buyers of businesses � those who wish to buy using only a sliver of equity � became unable to borrow all they thought they needed.  What they could still borrow, moreover, came at a high price.  Consequently, LBO operators became less aggressive in their bidding when businesses came up for sale last year.  Because we analyze purchases on an all-equity basis, our evaluations did not change, which means we became considerably more competitive.
�����Aside from the economic factors that benefited us, we now enjoy a major and growing advantage in making acquisitions in that we are often the buyer of choice for the seller.  That fact, of course, doesn�t assure a deal � sellers have to like our price, and we have to like their business and management � but it does help.
�����We find it meaningful when an owner cares about whom he sells to.  We like to do business with someone who loves his company, not just the money that a sale will bring him (though we certainly understand why he likes that as well).  When this emotional attachment exists, it signals that important qualities will likely be found within the business: honest accounting, pride of product, respect for customers, and a loyal group of associates having a strong sense of direction.  The reverse is apt to be true, also.  When an owner auctions off his business, exhibiting a total lack of interest in what follows, you will frequently find that it has been dressed up for sale, particularly when the seller is a "financial owner."  And if owners behave with little regard for their business and its people, their conduct will often contaminate attitudes and practices throughout the company.
�����When a business masterpiece has been created by a lifetime � or several lifetimes � of unstinting care and exceptional talent, it should be important to the owner what corporation is entrusted to carry on its history.  Charlie and I believe Berkshire provides an almost unique home.  We take our obligations to the people who created a business very seriously, and Berkshire�s ownership structure ensures that we can fulfill our promises.  When we tell John Justin that his business will remain headquartered in Fort Worth, or assure the Bridge family that its operation will not be merged with another jeweler, these sellers can take those promises to the bank.
�����How much better it is for the "painter" of a business Rembrandt to personally select its permanent home than to have a trust officer or uninterested heirs auction it off.  Throughout the years we have had great experiences with those who recognize that truth and apply it to their business creations.  We�ll leave the auctions to others.

The Economics of Property/Casualty Insurance
�����Our main business � though we have others of great importance � is insurance.  To understand Berkshire, therefore, it is necessary that you understand how to evaluate an insurance company.  The key determinants are: (1) the amount of float that the business generates; (2) its cost; and (3) most critical of all, the long-term outlook for both of these factors.
�����To begin with, float is money we hold but don't own.  In an insurance operation, float arises because premiums are received before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes extends over many years.  During that time, the insurer invests the money.  This pleasant activity typically carries with it a downside:  The premiums that an insurer takes in usually do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay.  That leaves it running an "underwriting loss," which is the cost of float.  An insurance business has value if its cost of float over time is less than the cost the company would otherwise incur to obtain funds.  But the business is a lemon if its cost of float is higher than market rates for money.
�����A caution is appropriate here:  Because loss costs must be estimated, insurers have enormous latitude in figuring their underwriting results, and that makes it very difficult for investors to calculate a company's true cost of float.  Errors of estimation, usually innocent but sometimes not, can be huge.  The consequences of these miscalculations flow directly into earnings.  An experienced observer can usually detect large-scale errors in reserving, but the general public can typically do no more than accept what's presented, and at times I have been amazed by the numbers that big-name auditors have implicitly blessed.  Both the income statements and balance sheets of insurers can be minefields.
�����At Berkshire, we strive to be both consistent and conservative in our reserving.  But we will make mistakes.  And we warn you that there is nothing symmetrical about surprises in the insurance business: They almost always are unpleasant.
�����The table that follows shows (at intervals) the float generated by the various segments of Berkshire�s insurance operations since we entered the business 34 years ago upon acquiring National Indemnity Company (whose traditional lines are included in the segment "Other Primary").  For the table we have calculated our float � which we generate in large amounts relative to our premium volume � by adding net loss reserves, loss adjustment reserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned premium reserves, and then subtracting insurance-related receivables, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid taxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance.  (Don�t panic, there won�t be a quiz.)

�����We�re pleased by the growth in our float during 2000 but not happy with its cost.  Over the years, our cost of float has been very close to zero, with the underwriting profits realized in most years offsetting the occasional terrible year such as 1984, when our cost was a staggering 19%.  In 2000, however, we had an underwriting loss of $1.6 billion, which gave us a float cost of 6%.  Absent a mega-catastrophe, we expect our float cost to fall in 2001 � perhaps substantially � in large part because of corrections in pricing at General Re that should increasingly be felt as the year progresses.  On a smaller scale, GEICO may experience the same improving trend.
�����There are two factors affecting our cost of float that are very rare at other insurers but that now loom large at Berkshire.  First, a few insurers that are currently experiencing large losses have offloaded a significant portion of these on us in a manner that penalizes our current earnings but gives us float we can use for many years to come.  After the loss that we incur in the first year of the policy, there are no further costs attached to this business.
�����When these policies are properly priced, we welcome the pain-today, gain-tomorrow effects they have.  In 1999, $400 million of our underwriting loss (about 27.8% of the total) came from business of this kind and in 2000 the figure was $482 million (34.4% of our loss).  We have no way of predicting how much similar business we will write in the future, but what we do get will typically be in large chunks.  Because these transactions can materially distort our figures, we will tell you about them as they occur.
�����Other reinsurers have little taste for this insurance.  They simply can�t stomach what huge underwriting losses do to their reported results, even though these losses are produced by policies whose overall economics are certain to be favorable.  You should be careful, therefore, in comparing our underwriting results with those of other insurers.
�����An even more significant item in our numbers � which, again, you won�t find much of elsewhere � arises from transactions in which we assume past losses of a company that wants to put its troubles behind it.  To illustrate, the XYZ insurance company might have last year bought a policy obligating us to pay the first $1 billion of losses and loss adjustment expenses from events that happened in, say, 1995 and earlier years.  These contracts can be very large, though we always require a cap on our exposure.  We entered into a number of such transactions in 2000 and expect to close several more in 2001.
�����Under GAAP accounting, this "retroactive" insurance neither benefits nor penalizes our current earnings.  Instead, we set up an asset called "deferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance," in an amount reflecting the difference between the premium we receive and the (higher) losses we expect to pay (for which reserves are immediately established).  We then amortize this asset by making annual charges to earnings that create equivalent underwriting losses.  You will find the amount of the loss that we incur from these transactions in both our quarterly and annual management discussion.  By their nature, these losses will continue for many years, often stretching into decades.  As an offset, though, we have the use of float � lots of it.
�����Clearly, float carrying an annual cost of this kind is not as desirable as float we generate from policies that are expected to produce an underwriting profit (of which we have plenty).  Nevertheless, this retroactive insurance should be decent business for us.
�����The net of all this is that a) I expect our cost of float to be very attractive in the future but b) rarely to return to a "no-cost" mode because of the annual charge that retroactive reinsurance will lay on us.  Also � obviously � the ultimate benefits that we derive from float will depend not only on its cost but, fully as important, how effectively we deploy it.
�����Our retroactive business is almost single-handedly the work of Ajit Jain, whose praises I sing annually.  It is impossible to overstate how valuable Ajit is to Berkshire.  Don�t worry about my health; worry about his.
�����Last year, Ajit brought home a $2.4 billion reinsurance premium, perhaps the largest in history, from a policy that retroactively covers a major U.K. company.  Subsequently, he wrote a large policy protecting the Texas Rangers from the possibility that Alex Rodriguez will become permanently disabled.  As sports fans know, "A-Rod" was signed for $252 million, a record, and we think that our policy probably also set a record for disability insurance.  We cover many other sports figures as well.
�����In another example of his versatility, Ajit last fall negotiated a very interesting deal with Grab.com, an Internet company whose goal was to attract millions of people to its site and there to extract information from them that would be useful to marketers.  To lure these people, Grab.com held out the possibility of a $1 billion prize (having a $170 million present value) and we insured its payment.  A message on the site explained that the chance of anyone winning the prize was low, and indeed no one won.  But the possibility of a win was far from nil.
�����Writing such a policy, we receive a modest premium, face the possibility of a huge loss, and get good odds. Very few insurers like that equation.  And they�re unable to cure their unhappiness by reinsurance.  Because each policy has unusual � and sometimes unique � characteristics, insurers can�t lay off the occasional shock loss through their standard reinsurance arrangements.  Therefore, any insurance CEO doing a piece of business like this must run the small, but real, risk of a horrible quarterly earnings number, one that he would not enjoy explaining to his board or shareholders.  Charlie and I, however, like any proposition that makes compelling mathematical sense, regardless of its effect on reported earnings.
�����At General Re, the news has turned considerably better:  Ron Ferguson, along with Joe Brandon, Tad Montross, and a talented supporting cast took many actions during 2000 to bring that company�s profitability back to past standards.  Though our pricing is not fully corrected, we have significantly repriced business that was severely unprofitable or dropped it altogether.  If there�s no mega-catastrophe in 2001, General Re�s float cost should fall materially.
�����The last couple of years haven�t been any fun for Ron and his crew.  But they have stepped up to tough decisions, and Charlie and I applaud them for these.  General Re has several important and enduring business advantages.  Better yet, it has managers who will make the most of them.
�����In aggregate, our smaller insurance operations produced an excellent underwriting profit in 2000 while generating significant float � just as they have done for more than a decade.  If these companies were a single and separate operation, people would consider it an outstanding insurer.  Because the companies instead reside in an enterprise as large as Berkshire, the world may not appreciate their accomplishments � but I sure do.  Last year I thanked Rod Eldred, John Kizer, Don Towle and Don Wurster, and I again do so.  In addition, we now also owe thanks to Tom Nerney at U.S. Liability and Michael Stearns, the new head of Cypress.
�����You may notice that Brad Kinstler, who was CEO of Cypress and whose praises I�ve sung in the past, is no longer in the list above.  That�s because we needed a new manager at Fechheimer Bros., our Cincinnati-based uniform company, and called on Brad.  We seldom move Berkshire managers from one enterprise to another, but maybe we should try it more often:  Brad is hitting home runs in his new job, just as he always did at Cypress.
GEICO (1-800-847-7536 or GEICO.com)
�����We show below the usual table detailing GEICO�s growth.  Last year I enthusiastically told you that we would step up our expenditures on advertising in 2000 and that the added dollars were the best investment that GEICO could make.  I was wrong:  The extra money we spent did not produce a commensurate increase in inquiries.  Additionally, the percentage of inquiries that we converted into sales fell for the first time in many years.  These negative developments combined to produce a sharp increase in our per-policy acquisition cost.

�����(1)  "Voluntary" only; excludes assigned risks and the like.
�����Agonizing over errors is a mistake.  But acknowledging and analyzing them can be useful, though that practice is rare in corporate boardrooms.  There, Charlie and I have almost never witnessed a candid post-mortem of a failed decision, particularly one involving an acquisition.  A notable exception to this never-look-back approach is that of The Washington Post Company, which unfailingly and objectively reviews its acquisitions three years after they are made.  Elsewhere, triumphs are trumpeted, but dumb decisions either get no follow-up or are rationalized.
�����The financial consequences of these boners are regularly dumped into massive restructuring charges or write-offs that are casually waved off as "nonrecurring."  Managements just love these.  Indeed, in recent years it has seemed that no earnings statement is complete without them.  The origins of these charges, though, are never explored.  When it comes to corporate blunders, CEOs invoke the concept of the Virgin Birth.
�����To get back to our examination of GEICO:  There are at least four factors that could account for the increased costs we experienced in obtaining new business last year, and all probably contributed in some manner.
�����First, in our advertising we have pushed "frequency" very hard, and we probably overstepped in certain media.  We�ve always known that increasing the number of messages through any medium would eventually produce diminishing returns.  The third ad in an hour on a given cable channel is simply not going to be as effective as the first.
�����Second, we may have already picked much of the low-hanging fruit.  Clearly, the willingness to do business with a direct marketer of insurance varies widely among individuals:  Indeed, some percentage of Americans � particularly older ones � are reluctant to make direct purchases of any kind.  Over the years, however, this reluctance will ebb.  A new generation with new habits will find the savings from direct purchase of their auto insurance too compelling to ignore.
�����Another factor that surely decreased the conversion of inquiries into sales was stricter underwriting by GEICO.  Both the frequency and severity of losses increased during the year, and rates in certain areas became inadequate, in some cases substantially so. In these instances, we necessarily tightened our underwriting standards.  This tightening, as well as the many rate increases we put in during the year, made our offerings less attractive to some prospects.
�����A high percentage of callers, it should be emphasized, can still save money by insuring with us.  Understandably, however, some prospects will switch to save $200 per year but will not switch to save $50.  Therefore, rate increases that bring our prices closer to those of our competitors will hurt our acceptance rate, even when we continue to offer the best deal.
�����Finally, the competitive picture changed in at least one important respect:  State Farm � by far the largest personal auto insurer, with about 19% of the market � has been very slow to raise prices.  Its costs, however, are clearly increasing right along with those of the rest of the industry.  Consequently, State Farm had an underwriting loss last year from auto insurance (including rebates to policyholders) of 18% of premiums, compared to 4% at GEICO.  Our loss produced a float cost for us of 6.1%, an unsatisfactory result.  (Indeed, at GEICO we expect float, over time, to be free.)  But we estimate that State Farm�s float cost in 2000 was about 23%.  The willingness of the largest player in the industry to tolerate such a cost makes the economics difficult for other participants.
�����That does not take away from the fact that State Farm is one of America�s greatest business stories.  I�ve urged that the company be studied at business schools because it has achieved fabulous success while following a path that in many ways defies the dogma of those institutions.  Studying counter-evidence is a highly useful activity, though not one always greeted with enthusiasm at citadels of learning.
�����State Farm was launched in 1922, by a 45-year-old, semi-retired Illinois farmer, to compete with long-established insurers � haughty institutions in New York, Philadelphia and Hartford � that possessed overwhelming advantages in capital, reputation, and distribution.  Because State Farm is a mutual company, its board members and managers could not be owners, and it had no access to capital markets during its years of fast growth.  Similarly, the business never had the stock options or lavish salaries that many people think vital if an American enterprise is to attract able managers and thrive.
�����In the end, however, State Farm eclipsed all its competitors.  In fact, by 1999 the company had amassed a tangible net worth exceeding that of all but four American businesses.  If you want to read how this happened, get a copy of The Farmer from Merna.
�����Despite State Farm�s strengths, however, GEICO has much the better business model, one that embodies significantly lower operating costs.  And, when a company is selling a product with commodity-like economic characteristics, being the low-cost producer is all-important.  This enduring competitive advantage of GEICO � one it possessed in 1951 when, as a 20-year-old student, I first became enamored with its stock � is the reason that over time it will inevitably increase its market share significantly while simultaneously achieving excellent profits.  Our growth will be slow, however, if State Farm elects to continue bearing the underwriting losses that it is now suffering.
�����Tony Nicely, GEICO�s CEO, remains an owner�s dream.  Everything he does makes sense.  He never engages in wishful thinking or otherwise distorts reality, as so many managers do when the unexpected happens.  As 2000 unfolded, Tony cut back on advertising that was not cost-effective, and he will continue to do that in 2001 if cutbacks are called for (though we will always maintain a massive media presence).  Tony has also aggressively filed for price increases where we need them.  He looks at the loss reports every day and is never behind the curve.  To steal a line from a competitor, we are in good hands with Tony.
�����I�ve told you about our profit-sharing arrangement at GEICO that targets only two variables � growth in policies and the underwriting results of seasoned business.  Despite the headwinds of 2000, we still had a performance that produced an 8.8% profit-sharing payment, amounting to $40.7 million.
�����GEICO will be a huge part of Berkshire�s future.  Because of its rock-bottom operating costs, it offers a great many Americans the cheapest way to purchase a high-ticket product that they must buy.  The company then couples this bargain with service that consistently ranks high in independent surveys.  That�s a combination inevitably producing growth and profitability.
�����In just the last few years, far more drivers have learned to associate the GEICO brand with saving money on their insurance.  We will pound that theme relentlessly until all Americans are aware of the value that we offer.

�����In 2000, we sold nearly all of our Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae shares, established 15% positions in several mid-sized companies, bought the high-yield bonds of a few issuers (very few � the category is not labeled junk without reason) and added to our holdings of high-grade, mortgage-backed securities.  There are no "bargains" among our current holdings:  We�re content with what we own but far from excited by it.
�����Many people assume that marketable securities are Berkshire�s first choice when allocating capital, but that�s not true: Ever since we first published our economic principles in 1983, we have consistently stated that we would rather purchase businesses than stocks.  (See number 4 on page 60.)  One reason for that preference is personal, in that I love working with our managers.  They are high-grade, talented and loyal.  And, frankly, I find their business behavior to be more rational and owner-oriented than that prevailing at many public companies.
�����But there�s also a powerful financial reason behind the preference, and that has to do with taxes.  The tax code makes Berkshire�s owning 80% or more of a business far more profitable for us, proportionately, than our owning a smaller share.  When a company we own all of earns $1 million after tax, the entire amount inures to our benefit.  If the $1 million is upstreamed to Berkshire, we owe no tax on the dividend.  And, if the earnings are retained and we were to sell the subsidiary � not likely at Berkshire! � for $1 million more than we paid for it, we would owe no capital gains tax.  That�s because our "tax cost" upon sale would include both what we paid for the business and all earnings it subsequently retained.
�����Contrast that situation to what happens when we own an investment in a marketable security.  There, if we own a 10% stake in a business earning $10 million after tax, our $1 million share of the earnings is subject to additional state and federal taxes of (1) about $140,000 if it is distributed to us (our tax rate on most dividends is 14%); or (2) no less than $350,000 if the $1 million is retained and subsequently captured by us in the form of a capital gain (on which our tax rate is usually about 35%, though it sometimes approaches 40%).  We may defer paying the $350,000 by not immediately realizing our gain, but eventually we must pay the tax.  In effect, the government is our "partner" twice when we own part of a business through a stock investment, but only once when we own at least 80%.
�����Leaving aside tax factors, the formula we use for evaluating stocks and businesses is identical.  Indeed, the formula for valuing all assets that are purchased for financial gain has been unchanged since it was first laid out by a very smart man in about 600 B.C.  (though he wasn�t smart enough to know it was 600 B.C.).
�����The oracle was Aesop and his enduring, though somewhat incomplete, investment insight was "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."  To flesh out this principle, you must answer only three questions.  How certain are you that there are indeed birds in the bush?  When will they emerge and how many will there be?  What is the risk-free interest rate (which we consider to be the yield on long-term U.S. bonds)?  If you can answer these three questions, you will know the maximum value of the bush � and the maximum number of the birds you now possess that should be offered for it.  And, of course, don�t literally think birds.  Think dollars.
�����Aesop�s investment axiom, thus expanded and converted into dollars, is immutable.  It applies to outlays for farms, oil royalties, bonds, stocks, lottery tickets, and manufacturing plants.  And neither the advent of the steam engine, the harnessing of electricity nor the creation of the automobile changed the formula one iota � nor will the Internet.  Just insert the correct numbers, and you can rank the attractiveness of all possible uses of capital throughout the universe.
�����Common yardsticks such as dividend yield, the ratio of price to earnings or to book value, and even growth rates have nothing to do with valuation except to the extent they provide clues to the amount and timing of cash flows into and from the business.  Indeed, growth can destroy value if it requires cash inputs in the early years of a project or enterprise that exceed the discounted value of the cash that those assets will generate in later years.  Market commentators and investment managers who glibly refer to "growth" and "value" styles as contrasting approaches to investment are displaying their ignorance, not their sophistication.  Growth is simply a component � usually a plus, sometimes a minus � in the value equation.
�����Alas, though Aesop�s proposition and the third variable � that is, interest rates � are simple, plugging in numbers for the other two variables is a difficult task.  Using precise numbers is, in fact, foolish; working with a range of possibilities is the better approach.
�����Usually, the range must be so wide that no useful conclusion can be reached.  Occasionally, though, even very conservative estimates about the future emergence of birds reveal that the price quoted is startlingly low in relation to value.  (Let�s call this phenomenon the IBT � Inefficient Bush Theory.)  To be sure, an investor needs some general understanding of business economics as well as the ability to think independently to reach a well-founded positive conclusion.  But the investor does not need brilliance nor blinding insights.
�����At the other extreme, there are many times when the most brilliant of investors can�t muster a conviction about the birds to emerge, not even when a very broad range of estimates is employed.  This kind of uncertainty frequently occurs when new businesses and rapidly changing industries are under examination.  In cases of this sort, any capital commitment must be labeled speculative.
�����Now, speculation � in which the focus is not on what an asset will produce but rather on what the next fellow will pay for it � is neither illegal, immoral nor un-American.  But it is not a game in which Charlie and I wish to play.  We bring nothing to the party, so why should we expect to take anything home?
�����The line separating investment and speculation, which is never bright and clear, becomes blurred still further when most market participants have recently enjoyed triumphs.  Nothing sedates rationality like large doses of effortless money.  After a heady experience of that kind, normally sensible people drift into behavior akin to that of Cinderella at the ball.  They know that overstaying the festivities � that is, continuing to speculate in companies that have gigantic valuations relative to the cash they are likely to generate in the future � will eventually bring on pumpkins and mice.  But they nevertheless hate to miss a single minute of what is one helluva party.  Therefore, the giddy participants all plan to leave just seconds before midnight.  There�s a problem, though: They are dancing in a room in which the clocks have no hands.
�����Last year, we commented on the exuberance � and, yes, it was irrational � that prevailed, noting that investor expectations had grown to be several multiples of probable returns.  One piece of evidence came from a Paine Webber-Gallup survey of investors conducted in December 1999, in which the participants were asked their opinion about the annual returns investors could expect to realize over the decade ahead.  Their answers averaged 19%.  That, for sure, was an irrational expectation:  For American business as a whole, there couldn�t possibly be enough birds in the 2009 bush to deliver such a return.
�����Far more irrational still were the huge valuations that market participants were then putting on businesses almost certain to end up being of modest or no value.  Yet investors, mesmerized by soaring stock prices and ignoring all else, piled into these enterprises.  It was as if some virus, racing wildly among investment professionals as well as amateurs, induced hallucinations in which the values of stocks in certain sectors became decoupled from the values of the businesses that underlay them.
�����This surreal scene was accompanied by much loose talk about "value creation."  We readily acknowledge that there has been a huge amount of true value created in the past decade by new or young businesses, and that there is much more to come.  But value is destroyed, not created, by any business that loses money over its lifetime, no matter how high its interim valuation may get.
�����What actually occurs in these cases is wealth transfer, often on a massive scale.  By shamelessly merchandising birdless bushes, promoters have in recent years moved billions of dollars from the pockets of the public to their own purses (and to those of their friends and associates).  The fact is that a bubble market has allowed the creation of bubble companies, entities designed more with an eye to making money off investors rather than for them.  Too often, an IPO, not profits, was the primary goal of a company�s promoters.  At bottom, the "business model" for these companies has been the old-fashioned chain letter, for which many fee-hungry investment bankers acted as eager postmen.
�����But a pin lies in wait for every bubble.  And when the two eventually meet, a new wave of investors learns some very old lessons:  First, many in Wall Street � a community in which quality control is not prized � will sell investors anything they will buy.  Second, speculation is most dangerous when it looks easiest.
�����At Berkshire, we make no attempt to pick the few winners that will emerge from an ocean of unproven enterprises.  We�re not smart enough to do that, and we know it.  Instead, we try to apply Aesop�s 2,600-year-old equation to opportunities in which we have reasonable confidence as to how many birds are in the bush and when they will emerge  (a formulation that my grandsons would probably update to "A girl in a convertible is worth five in the phonebook.").  Obviously, we can never precisely predict the timing of cash flows in and out of a business or their exact amount.  We try, therefore, to keep our estimates conservative and to focus on industries where business surprises are unlikely to wreak havoc on owners.  Even so, we make many mistakes:  I�m the fellow, remember, who thought he understood the future economics of trading stamps, textiles, shoes and second-tier department stores.
�����Lately, the most promising "bushes" have been negotiated transactions for entire businesses, and that pleases us.  You should clearly understand, however, that these acquisitions will at best provide us only reasonable returns.  Really juicy results from negotiated deals can be anticipated only when capital markets are severely constrained and the whole business world is pessimistic.  We are 180 degrees from that point.

Sources of Reported Earnings
�����The table that follows shows the main sources of Berkshire's reported earnings.  In this presentation, purchase-accounting adjustments are not assigned to the specific businesses to which they apply, but are instead aggregated and shown separately.  This procedure lets you view the earnings of our businesses as they would have been reported had we not purchased them.  For the reasons discussed on page 65, this form of presentation seems to us to be more useful to investors and managers than one utilizing generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which require purchase-premiums to be charged off business-by-business.  The total net earnings we show in the table are, of course, identical to the GAAP total in our audited financial statements.

�����Most of our manufacturing, retailing and service businesses did at least reasonably well last year.
�����The exception was shoes, particularly at Dexter.  In our shoe businesses generally, our attempt to keep the bulk of our production in domestic factories has cost us dearly.  We face another very tough year in 2001 also, as we make significant changes in how we do business.
�����I clearly made a mistake in paying what I did for Dexter in 1993.  Furthermore, I compounded that mistake in a huge way by using Berkshire shares in payment.  Last year, to recognize my error, we charged off all the remaining accounting goodwill that was attributable to the Dexter transaction.  We may regain some economic goodwill at Dexter in the future, but we clearly have none at present.
�����The managers of our shoe businesses are first-class from both a business and human perspective.  They are working very hard at a tough � and often terribly painful � job, even though their personal financial circumstances don�t require them to do so.  They have my admiration and thanks.
�����On a more pleasant note, we continue to be the undisputed leader in two branches of Aircraft Services � pilot training at FlightSafety (FSI) and fractional ownership of business jets at Executive Jet (EJA).  Both companies are run by their remarkable founders.
�����Al Ueltschi at FSI is now 83 and continues to operate at full throttle.  Though I am not a fan of stock splits, I am planning to split Al�s age 2-for-1 when he hits 100.  (If it works, guess who�s next.)
�����We spent $272 million on flight simulators in 2000, and we�ll spend a similar amount this year.  Anyone who thinks that the annual charges for depreciation don�t reflect a real cost � every bit as real as payroll or raw materials � should get an internship at a simulator company.  Every year we spend amounts equal to our depreciation charge simply to stay in the same economic place � and then spend additional sums to grow.  And growth is in prospect for FSI as far as the eye can see.
�����Even faster growth awaits EJA (whose fractional-ownership program is called NetJets�).  Rich Santulli is the dynamo behind this business.
�����Last year I told you that EJA�s recurring revenue from monthly management fees and hourly usage grew by 46% in 1999.  In 2000 the growth was 49%.  I also told you that this was a low-margin business, in which survivors will be few.  Margins were indeed slim at EJA last year, in part because of the major costs we are incurring in developing our business in Europe.
�����Regardless of the cost, you can be sure that EJA�s spending on safety will be whatever is needed.  Obviously, we would follow this policy under any circumstances, but there�s some self-interest here as well:  I, my wife, my children, my sisters, my 94-year-old aunt, all but one of our directors, and at least nine Berkshire managers regularly fly in the NetJets program.  Given that cargo, I applaud Rich�s insistence on unusually high amounts of pilot training (an average of 23 days a year).  In addition, our pilots cement their skills by flying 800 or so hours a year.  Finally, each flies only one model of aircraft, which means our crews do no switching around among planes with different cockpit and flight characteristics.
�����EJA�s business continues to be constrained by the availability of new aircraft.  Still, our customers will take delivery of more than 50 new jets in 2001, 7% of world output.  We are confident we will remain the world leader in fractional ownership, in respect to number of planes flying, quality of service, and standards of safety.
* * * * * * * * * *
�����Additional information about our various businesses is given on pages 42-58, where you will also find our segment earnings reported on a GAAP basis.  In addition, on pages 67-73, we have rearranged Berkshire�s financial data into four segments on a non-GAAP basis, a presentation that corresponds to the way Charlie and I think about the company.
Look-Through Earnings
�����Reported earnings are an inadequate measure of economic progress at Berkshire, in part because the numbers shown in the table on page 15 include only the dividends we receive from investees � though these dividends typically represent only a small fraction of the earnings attributable to our ownership.  To depict something closer to economic reality at Berkshire than reported earnings, though, we employ the concept of "look-through" earnings.  As we calculate these, they consist of: (1) the operating earnings reported on page 15; plus; (2) our share of the retained operating earnings of major investees that, under GAAP accounting, are not reflected in our profits, less; (3) an allowance for the tax that would be paid by Berkshire if these retained earnings of investees had instead been distributed to us.  When tabulating "operating earnings" here, we exclude purchase-accounting adjustments as well as capital gains and other major non-recurring items.
�����The following table sets forth our 2000 look-through earnings, though I warn you that the figures can be no more than approximate, since they are based on a number of judgment calls.  (The dividends paid to us by these investees have been included in the operating earnings itemized on page 15, mostly under "Insurance Group:  Net Investment Income.")

Full and Fair Reporting 
�����At Berkshire, full reporting means giving you the information that we would wish you to give to us if our positions were reversed.  What Charlie and I would want under that circumstance would be all the important facts about current operations as well as the CEO�s frank view of the long-term economic characteristics of the business.  We would expect both a lot of financial details and a discussion of any significant data we would need to interpret what was presented.
�����When Charlie and I read reports, we have no interest in pictures of personnel, plants or products.  References to EBITDA make us shudder  � does management think the tooth fairy pays for capital expenditures?  We�re very suspicious of accounting methodology that is vague or unclear, since too often that means management wishes to hide something.  And we don�t want to read messages that a public relations department or consultant has turned out.  Instead, we expect a company�s CEO to explain in his or her own words what�s happening.
�����For us, fair reporting means getting information to our 300,000 "partners" simultaneously, or as close to that mark as possible.  We therefore put our annual and quarterly financials on the Internet between the close of the market on a Friday and the following morning.  By our doing that, shareholders and other interested investors have timely access to these important releases and also have a reasonable amount of time to digest the information they include before the markets open on Monday.  This year our quarterly information will be available on the Saturdays of May 12, August 11, and November 10.  The 2001 annual report will be posted on March 9.
�����We applaud the work that Arthur Levitt, Jr., until recently Chairman of the SEC, has done in cracking down on the corporate practice of "selective disclosure" that had spread like cancer in recent years.  Indeed, it had become virtually standard practice for major corporations to "guide" analysts or large holders to earnings expectations that were intended either to be on the nose or a tiny bit below what the company truly expected to earn.  Through the selectively dispersed hints, winks and nods that companies engaged in, speculatively-minded institutions and advisors were given an information edge over investment-oriented individuals.  This was corrupt behavior, unfortunately embraced by both Wall Street and corporate America.
�����Thanks to Chairman Levitt, whose general efforts on behalf of investors were both tireless and effective, corporations are now required to treat all of their owners equally.  The fact that this reform came about because of coercion rather than conscience should be a matter of shame for CEOs and their investor relations departments.
�����One further thought while I�m on my soapbox: Charlie and I think it is both deceptive and dangerous for CEOs to predict growth rates for their companies.  They are, of course, frequently egged on to do so by both analysts and their own investor relations departments.  They should resist, however, because too often these predictions lead to trouble.
�����It�s fine for a CEO to have his own internal goals and, in our view, it�s even appropriate for the CEO to publicly express some hopes about the future, if these expectations are accompanied by sensible caveats.  But for a major corporation to predict that its per-share earnings will grow over the long term at, say, 15% annually is to court trouble.
�����That�s true because a growth rate of that magnitude can only be maintained by a very small percentage of large businesses.  Here�s a test:  Examine the record of, say, the 200 highest earning companies from 1970 or 1980 and tabulate how many have increased per-share earnings by 15% annually since those dates.  You will find that only a handful have.  I would wager you a very significant sum that fewer than 10 of the 200 most profitable companies in 2000 will attain 15% annual growth in earnings-per-share over the next 20 years.
�����The problem arising from lofty predictions is not just that they spread unwarranted optimism.  Even more troublesome is the fact that they corrode CEO behavior.  Over the years, Charlie and I have observed many instances in which CEOs engaged in uneconomic operating maneuvers so that they could meet earnings targets they had announced.  Worse still, after exhausting all that operating acrobatics would do, they sometimes played a wide variety of accounting games to "make the numbers." These accounting shenanigans have a way of snowballing:  Once a company moves earnings from one period to another, operating shortfalls that occur thereafter require it to engage in further accounting maneuvers that must be even more "heroic."  These can turn fudging into fraud.  (More money, it has been noted, has been stolen with the point of a pen than at the point of a gun.)
�����Charlie and I tend to be leery of companies run by CEOs who woo investors with fancy predictions.  A few of these managers will prove prophetic � but others will turn out to be congenital optimists, or even charlatans.  Unfortunately, it�s not easy for investors to know in advance which species they are dealing with.
* * * * * * * * * * * *
�����I�ve warned you in the past that you should not believe everything you read or hear about Berkshire � even when it is published or broadcast by a prestigious news organization.  Indeed, erroneous reports are particularly dangerous when they are circulated by highly-respected members of the media, simply because most readers and listeners know these outlets to be generally credible and therefore believe what they say.
�����An example is a glaring error about Berkshire�s activities that appeared in the December 29 issue of The Wall Street Journal, a generally excellent paper that I have for all of my life found useful.  On the front page (and above the fold, as they say) The Journal published a news brief that said, in unequivocal terms, that we were buying bonds of Conseco and Finova.  This item directed the reader to the lead story of the Money and Investing section.  There, in the second paragraph of the story, The Journal reported, again without any qualification, that Berkshire was buying Conseco and Finova bonds, adding that Berkshire had invested "several hundred million dollars" in each.  Only in the 18th paragraph of the story (which by that point had jumped to an inside page) did the paper hedge a bit, saying that our Conseco purchases had been disclosed by "people familiar with the matter."
Well, not that familiar.  True, we had purchased bonds and bank debt of Finova � though the report was wildly inaccurate as to the amount.  But to this day neither Berkshire nor I have ever bought a share of stock or a bond of Conseco.
�����Berkshire is normally covered by a Journal reporter in Chicago who is both accurate and conscientious.  In this case, however, the "scoop" was the product of a New York reporter for the paper.  Indeed, the 29th was a busy day for him:  By early afternoon, he had repeated the story on CNBC.  Immediately, in lemming-like manner, other respected news organizations, relying solely on the Journal, began relating the same "facts."  The result:  Conseco stock advanced sharply during the day on exceptional volume that placed it ninth on the NYSE most-active list.
�����During all of the story�s iterations, I never heard or read the word "rumor."  Apparently reporters and editors, who generally pride themselves on their careful use of language, just can�t bring themselves to attach this word to their accounts.  But what description would fit more precisely?  Certainly not the usual "sources say" or "it has been reported."
�����A column entitled "Today�s Rumors," however, would not equate with the self-image of the many news organizations that think themselves above such stuff.  These members of the media would feel that publishing such acknowledged fluff would be akin to L�Osservatore Romano initiating a gossip column.  But rumors are what these organizations often publish and broadcast, whatever euphemism they duck behind.  At a minimum, readers deserve honest terminology � a warning label that will protect their financial health in the same way that smokers whose physical health is at risk are given a warning.
�����The Constitution�s First Amendment allows the media to print or say almost anything.  Journalism�s First Principle should require that the media be scrupulous in deciding what that will be. 
Miscellaneous
�����In last year�s report we examined the battle then raging over the use of "pooling" in accounting for mergers.  It seemed to us that both sides were voicing arguments that were strong in certain respects and seriously flawed in others.  We are pleased that the Financial Accounting Standards Board has since gone to an alternative approach that strikes us as very sound.
�����If the proposed rule becomes final, we will no longer incur a large annual charge for amortization of intangibles.  Consequently, our reported earnings will more closely reflect economic reality.  (See page 65.)  None of this will have an effect on Berkshire�s intrinsic value.  Your Chairman, however, will personally benefit in that there will be one less item to explain in these letters.

�����I�m enclosing a report � generously supplied by Outstanding Investor Digest � of Charlie�s remarks at last May�s Wesco annual meeting.  Charlie thinks about business economics and investment matters better than anyone I know, and I�ve learned a lot over the years by listening to him.  Reading his comments will improve your understanding of Berkshire.

�����In  1985, we purchased Scott Fetzer, acquiring not only a fine business but the services of Ralph Schey, a truly outstanding CEO, as well.  Ralph was then 61.  Most companies, focused on the calendar rather than ability, would have benefited from Ralph�s talents for only a few years.
�����At Berkshire, in contrast, Ralph ran Scott Fetzer for 15 years until his retirement at the end of 2000.  Under his leadership, the company distributed $1.03 billion to Berkshire against our net purchase price of $230 million.  We used these funds, in turn, to purchase other businesses.  All told, Ralph�s contributions to Berkshire�s present value extend well into the billions of dollars.
�����As a manager, Ralph belongs in Berkshire�s Hall of Fame, and Charlie and I welcome him to it.

�����A bit of nostalgia:  It was exactly 50 years ago that I entered Ben Graham�s class at Columbia.  During the decade before, I had enjoyed � make that loved � analyzing, buying and selling stocks.  But my results were no better than average.
�����Beginning in 1951 my performance improved.  No, I hadn�t changed my diet or taken up exercise.  The only new ingredient was Ben�s ideas.  Quite simply, a few hours spent at the feet of the master proved far more valuable to me than had ten years of supposedly original thinking.
�����In addition to being a great teacher, Ben was a wonderful friend.  My debt to him is incalculable.
Shareholder-Designated Contributions
�����About 97% of all eligible shares participated in Berkshire's 2000 shareholder-designated contributions program, with contributions totaling $16.9 million.  A full description of the program appears on pages 74-75.
�����Cumulatively, over the 20 years of the program, Berkshire has made contributions of $164 million pursuant to the instructions of our shareholders.  The rest of Berkshire's giving is done by our subsidiaries, which stick to the philanthropic patterns that prevailed before they were acquired (except that their former owners themselves take on the responsibility for their personal charities).  In aggregate, our subsidiaries made contributions of $18.3 million in 2000, including in-kind donations of $3 million.
�����To participate in future programs, you must own Class A shares that are registered in the name of the actual owner, not the nominee name of a broker, bank or depository.  Shares not so registered on August 31, 2001 will be ineligible for the 2001 program.  When you get the contributions form from us, return it promptly so that it does not get put aside or forgotten.  Designations received after the due date will not be honored. 
The Annual Meeting
�����Last year we moved the annual meeting to the Civic Auditorium, and it worked very well for us.  We will meet there again on Saturday, April 28.  The doors will open at 7 a.m., the movie will begin at 8:30, and the meeting itself will commence at 9:30.  There will be a short break at noon for food, with sandwiches available at the Civic�s concession stands.  Except for that interlude, Charlie and I will answer questions until 3:30.
�����For the next couple of years, the Civic is our only choice.  We must therefore hold the meeting on either Saturday or Sunday to avoid the traffic and parking nightmare that would occur on a weekday.  Shortly, however, Omaha will have a new Convention Center with ample parking.  Assuming that the Center is then available to us, I will poll shareholders to see whether you wish to return to a Monday meeting.  We will decide that vote based on the wishes of a majority of shareholders, not shares.
�����An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the credential you will need for admission to this year�s meeting and other events.  As for plane, hotel and car reservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  In our normal fashion, we will run buses from the larger hotels to the meeting.  After the meeting, the buses will make trips back to the hotels and to Nebraska Furniture Mart, Borsheim's and the airport.  Even so, you are likely to find a car useful.
�����We have added so many new companies to Berkshire this year that I�m not going to detail all of the products that we will be selling at the meeting.  But come prepared to carry home everything from bricks to candy.  One new product, however, deserves special note:  Bob Shaw has designed a 3 x 5 rug featuring an excellent likeness of Charlie.  Obviously, it would be embarrassing for Charlie � make that humiliating � if slow sales forced us to slash the rug�s price, so step up and do your part.
�����GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of them ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes.  In most cases, GEICO will be able to offer you a special shareholder's discount (usually 8%).  Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you some money.
�����At the Omaha airport on Saturday, we will have the usual array of aircraft from Executive Jet available for your inspection.  Just ask an EJA representative at the Civic about viewing any of these planes.  If you buy what we consider an appropriate number of items during the weekend, you may well need your own plane to take them home.
�����At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 75-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having "Berkshire Weekend" pricing, which means we will be offering our shareholders a discount that is customarily given only to employees.  We initiated this special pricing at NFM four years ago and sales during the "Weekend" grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $9.1 million in 2000.
�����To get the discount, you must make your purchases between Wednesday, April 25 and Monday, April 30 and also present your meeting credential.  The period�s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestige manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but that, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you.  We appreciate their cooperation.  NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.
�����Borsheim's � the largest jewelry store in the country except for Tiffany's Manhattan store � will have two shareholder-only events.  The first will be a cocktail reception from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, April 27.  The second, the main gala, will be from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday, April 29.  Shareholder prices will be available Thursday through Monday, so if you wish to avoid the large crowds that will assemble on Friday evening and Sunday, come at other times and identify yourself as a shareholder.  On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m.  Borsheim's operates on a gross margin that is fully twenty percentage points below that of its major rivals, so the more you buy, the more you save (or at least that�s what my family always tells me).
�����In the mall outside of Borsheim's, we will have local bridge experts available to play with our shareholders on Sunday.  Bob Hamman, who normally is with us, will be in Africa this year.  He has promised, however, to be on hand in 2002.  Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, will also be in the mall, taking on all comers � blindfolded!  Last year, Patrick played as many as six games simultaneously � with his blindfold securely in place � and demolished his opponents.
�����As if all this isn�t enough to test your skills, our Borsheim�s Olympiad this year will also include Bill Robertie, one of only two players to twice win the backgammon world championship.  Backgammon can be a big money game, so bring along your stock certificates.
�����Gorat's � my favorite steakhouse � will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, April 29, and will be serving from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m.  Please remember that you can't come to Gorat's on Sunday without a reservation.  To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 2 (but not before).  If Sunday is sold out, try Gorat's on one of the other evenings you will be in town.  If you order a rare T-bone with a double order of hash browns, you will establish your credentials as an epicure.
�����The usual baseball game will be held at Rosenblatt Stadium at 7 p.m. on Saturday night.  This year the Omaha Golden Spikes will play the New Orleans Zephyrs.  Ernie Banks is again going to be on hand to � bravely � face my fastball (once clocked at 95 mpm �
 miles per month).
�����My performance last year was not my best:  It took me five pitches to throw anything resembling a strike.  And, believe me, it gets lonely on the mound when you can�t find the plate.  Finally, I got one over, and Ernie lashed a line drive to left field.  After I was yanked from the game, the many sports writers present asked what I had served up to Ernie.  I quoted what Warren Spahn said after Willie Mays hit one of his pitches for a home run (Willie�s first in the majors):  "It was a helluva pitch for the first sixty feet."
�����It will be a different story this year.  I don�t want to tip my hand, so let�s just say Ernie will have to deal with a pitch he has never seen before.
�����Our proxy statement contains instructions about obtaining tickets to the game and also a large quantity of other information that should help you enjoy your visit in Omaha.  There will be plenty of action in town.  So come for Woodstock Weekend and join our Celebration of Capitalism at the Civic.

Notes:
Data are for calendar years with these exceptions:  1965 and 1966, year ended 9/30; 1967, 15 months ended 12/31.
Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previously the requirement.  In this table, Berkshire's results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules.  In all other respects, the results are calculated using the numbers originally reported.
The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax.  If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P in years when the index showed a negative return.  Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.


BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.

To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:

�����Berkshire�s loss in net worth during 2001 was $3.77 billion, which decreased the per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stock by 6.2%.  Over the last 37 years (that is, since present management took over) per-share book value has grown from $19 to $37,920, a rate of 22.6% compounded annually.*


*�����All figures used in this report apply 
          to Berkshire's A shares, the successor to the only stock that the company 
          had outstanding before 1996. The B shares have an economic interest 
          equal to 1/30th that of the A. 
       	

�����Per-share intrinsic grew somewhat faster than book value during these 37 years, and in 2001 it probably decreased a bit less.  We explain intrinsic value in our Owner�s Manual, which begins on page 62.  I urge new shareholders to read this manual to become familiar with Berkshire�s key economic principles.
�����Two years ago, reporting on 1999, I said that we had experienced both the worst absolute and relative performance in our history.  I added that "relative results are what concern us," a viewpoint I�ve had since forming my first investment partnership on May 5, 1956.  Meeting with my seven founding limited partners that evening, I gave them a short paper titled "The Ground Rules" that included this sentence: "Whether we do a good job or a poor job is to be measured against the general experience in securities."  We initially used the Dow Jones Industrials as our benchmark, but shifted to the S&P 500 when that index became widely used.  Our comparative record since 1965 is chronicled on the facing page; last year Berkshire�s advantage was 5.7 percentage points.
�����Some people disagree with our focus on relative figures, arguing that "you can�t eat relative performance." But if you expect � as Charlie Munger, Berkshire�s Vice Chairman, and I do � that owning the S&P 500 will produce reasonably satisfactory results over time, it follows that, for long-term investors, gaining small advantages annually over that index must prove rewarding.  Just as you can eat well throughout the year if you own a profitable, but highly seasonal, business such as See�s (which loses considerable money during the summer months) so, too, can you regularly feast on investment returns that beat the averages, however variable the absolute numbers may be.
�����Though our corporate performance last year was satisfactory, my performance was anything but.  I manage most of Berkshire�s equity portfolio, and my results were poor, just as they have been for several years.  Of even more importance, I allowed General Re to take on business without a safeguard I knew was important, and on September 11th, this error caught up with us.  I�ll tell you more about my mistake later and what we are doing to correct it.
�����Another of my 1956 Ground Rules remains applicable: "I cannot promise results to partners."  But Charlie and I can promise that your economic result from Berkshire will parallel ours during the period of your ownership: We will not take cash compensation, restricted stock or option grants that would make our results superior to yours.
�����Additionally, I will keep well over 99% of my net worth in Berkshire.  My wife and I have never sold a share nor do we intend to.  Charlie and I are disgusted by the situation, so common in the last few years, in which shareholders have suffered billions in losses while the CEOs, promoters, and other higher-ups who fathered these disasters have walked away with extraordinary wealth.  Indeed, many of these people were urging investors to buy shares while concurrently dumping their own, sometimes using methods that hid their actions. To their shame, these business leaders view shareholders as patsies, not partners.
�����Though Enron has become the symbol for shareholder abuse, there is no shortage of egregious conduct elsewhere in corporate America.  One story I�ve heard illustrates the all-too-common attitude of managers toward owners: A gorgeous woman slinks up to a CEO at a party and through moist lips purrs, "I�ll do anything � anything � you want.  Just tell me what you would like."  With no hesitation, he replies, "Reprice my options."
�����One final thought about Berkshire: In the future we won�t come close to replicating our past record.  To be sure, Charlie and I will strive for above-average performance and will not be satisfied with less.  But two conditions at Berkshire are far different from what they once were: Then, we could often buy businesses and securities at much lower valuations than now prevail; and more important, we were then working with far less money than we now have.  Some years back, a good $10 million idea could do wonders for us (witness our investment in Washington Post in 1973 or GEICO in 1976).  Today, the combination of ten such ideas and a triple in the value of each would increase the net worth of Berkshire by only � of 1%.  We need "elephants" to make significant gains now � and they are hard to find.
�����On the positive side, we have as fine an array of operating managers as exists at any company.  (You can read about many of them in a new book by Robert P. Miles: The Warren Buffett CEO.) In large part, moreover, they are running businesses with economic characteristics ranging from good to superb.  The ability, energy and loyalty of these managers is simply extraordinary.  We now have completed 37 Berkshire years without having a CEO of an operating business elect to leave us to work elsewhere.
�����Our star-studded group grew in 2001.  First, we completed the purchases of two businesses that we had agreed to buy in 2000 � Shaw and Johns Manville.  Then we acquired two others, MiTek and XTRA, and contracted to buy two more: Larson-Juhl, an acquisition that has just closed, and Fruit of the Loom, which will close shortly if creditors approve our offer.  All of these businesses are led by smart, seasoned and trustworthy CEOs.
�����Additionally, all of our purchases last year were for cash, which means our shareholders became owners of these additional businesses without relinquishing any interest in the fine companies they already owned.  We will continue to follow our familiar formula, striving to increase the value of the excellent businesses we have, adding new businesses of similar quality, and issuing shares only grudgingly. 
Acquisitions of 2001
�����A few days before last year�s annual meeting, I received a heavy package from St. Louis, containing an unprepossessing chunk of metal whose function I couldn�t imagine. There was a letter in the package, though, from Gene Toombs, CEO of a company called MiTek.  He explained that MiTek is the world�s leading producer of this thing I�d received, a "connector plate," which is used in making roofing trusses.  Gene also said that the U.K. parent of MiTek wished to sell the company and that Berkshire seemed to him the ideal buyer.  Liking the sound of his letter, I gave Gene a call.  It took me only a minute to realize that he was our kind of manager and MiTek our kind of business.  We made a cash offer to the U.K. owner and before long had a deal.
�����Gene�s managerial crew is exceptionally enthusiastic about the company and wanted to participate in the purchase.  Therefore, we arranged for 55 members of the MiTek team to buy 10% of the company, with each putting up a minimum of $100,000 in cash.  Many borrowed money so they could participate.
�����As they would not be if they had options, all of these managers are true owners.  They face the downside of decisions as well as the upside.  They incur a cost of capital.  And they can�t "reprice" their stakes: What they paid is what they live with.
�����Charlie and I love the high-grade, truly entrepreneurial attitude that exists at MiTek, and we predict it will be a winner for all involved.
* * * * * * * * * * * *
�����In early 2000, my friend, Julian Robertson, announced that he would terminate his investment partnership, Tiger Fund, and that he would liquidate it entirely except for four large holdings.  One of these was XTRA, a leading lessor of truck trailers.  I then called Julian, asking whether he might consider selling his XTRA block or whether, for that matter, the company�s management might entertain an offer for the entire company.  Julian referred me to Lew Rubin, XTRA�s CEO.  He and I had a nice conversation, but it was apparent that no deal was to be done.
�����Then in June 2001, Julian called to say that he had decided to sell his XTRA shares, and I resumed conversations with Lew.  The XTRA board accepted a proposal we made, which was to be effectuated through a tender offer expiring on September 11th.  The tender conditions included the usual "out," allowing us to withdraw if the stock market were to close before the offer�s expiration.  Throughout much of the 11th, Lew went through a particularly wrenching experience: First, he had a son-in-law working in the World Trade Center who couldn�t be located; and second, he knew we had the option of backing away from our purchase.  The story ended happily: Lew�s son-in-law escaped serious harm, and Berkshire completed the transaction.
�����Trailer leasing is a cyclical business but one in which we should earn decent returns over time.  Lew brings a new talent to Berkshire, and we hope to expand in leasing.
* * * * * * * * * * * *
�����On December 3rd, I received a call from Craig Ponzio, owner of Larson-Juhl, the U.S. leader in custom-made picture frames.  Craig had bought the company in 1981 (after first working at its manufacturing plant while attending college) and thereafter increased its sales from $3 million to $300 million.  Though I had never heard of Larson-Juhl before Craig�s call, a few minutes talk with him made me think we would strike a deal.  He was straightforward in describing the business, cared about who bought it, and was realistic as to price.  Two days later, Craig and Steve McKenzie, his CEO, came to Omaha and in ninety minutes we reached an agreement.  In ten days we had signed a contract.
�����Larson-Juhl serves about 18,000 framing shops in the U.S. and is also the industry leader in Canada and much of Europe.  We expect to see opportunities for making complementary acquisitions in the future.
* * * * * * * * * * *
�����As I write this letter, creditors are considering an offer we have made for Fruit of the Loom.  The company entered bankruptcy a few years back, a victim both of too much debt and poor management.  And, a good many years before that, I had some Fruit of the Loom experience of my own.
�����In August 1955, I was one of five employees, including two secretaries, working for the three managers of Graham-Newman Corporation, a New York investment company.  Graham-Newman controlled Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron ("P&R"), an anthracite producer that had excess cash, a tax loss carryforward, and a declining business.  At the time, I had a significant portion of my limited net worth invested in P&R shares, reflecting my faith in the business talents of my bosses, Ben Graham, Jerry Newman and Howard (Micky) Newman.
�����This faith was rewarded when P&R purchased the Union Underwear Company from Jack Goldfarb for $15 million.  Union (though it was then only a licensee of the name) produced Fruit of the Loom underwear.  The company possessed $5 million in cash � $2.5 million of which P&R used for the purchase � and was earning about $3 million pre-tax, earnings that could be sheltered by the tax position of P&R.  And, oh yes: Fully $9 million of the remaining $12.5 million due was satisfied by non-interest-bearing notes, payable from 50% of any earnings Union had in excess of $1 million.  (Those were the days; I get goosebumps just thinking about such deals.)
�����Subsequently, Union bought the licensor of the Fruit of the Loom name and, along with P&R, was merged into Northwest Industries.  Fruit went on to achieve annual pre-tax earnings exceeding $200 million.
�����John Holland was responsible for Fruit�s operations in its most bountiful years.  In 1996, however, John retired, and management loaded the company with debt, in part to make a series of acquisitions that proved disappointing.  Bankruptcy followed.  John was then rehired, and he undertook a major reworking of operations.  Before John�s return, deliveries were chaotic, costs soared and relations with key customers deteriorated.  While correcting these problems, John also reduced employment from a bloated 40,000 to 23,000.  In short, he�s been restoring the old Fruit of the Loom, albeit in a much more competitive environment.
�����Stepping into Fruit�s bankruptcy proceedings, we made a proposal to creditors to which we attached no financing conditions, even though our offer had to remain outstanding for many months.  We did, however, insist on a very unusual proviso: John had to be available to continue serving as CEO after we took over.  To us, John and the brand are Fruit�s key assets.
�����I was helped in this transaction by my friend and former boss, Micky Newman, now 81.  What goes around truly does come around.
* * * * * * * * * * * *
�����Our operating companies made several "bolt-on" acquisitions during the year, and I can�t resist telling you about one.  In December, Frank Rooney called to tell me H.H. Brown was buying the inventory and trademarks of Acme Boot for $700,000.
�����That sounds like small potatoes.  But � would you believe it? � Acme was the second purchase of P&R, an acquisition that took place just before I left Graham-Newman in the spring of 1956.  The price was $3.2 million, part of it again paid with non-interest bearing notes, for a business with sales of $7 million.
�����After P&R merged with Northwest, Acme grew to be the world�s largest bootmaker, delivering annual profits many multiples of what the company had cost P&R.  But the business eventually hit the skids and never recovered, and that resulted in our purchasing Acme�s remnants.
�����In the frontispiece to Security Analysis, Ben Graham and Dave Dodd quoted Horace: "Many shall be restored that now are fallen and many shall fall that are now in honor."  Fifty-two years after I first read those lines, my appreciation for what they say about business and investments continues to grow.

�����In addition to bolt-on acquisitions, our managers continually look for ways to grow internally.  In that regard, here�s a postscript to a story I told you two years ago about R.C. Willey�s move to Boise.  As you may remember, Bill Child, R.C. Willey�s chairman, wanted to extend his home-furnishings operation beyond Utah, a state in which his company does more than $300 million of business (up, it should be noted, from $250,000 when Bill took over 48 years ago).  The company achieved this dominant position, moreover, with a "closed on Sunday" policy that defied conventional retailing wisdom.  I was skeptical that this policy could succeed in Boise or, for that matter, anyplace outside of Utah.  After all, Sunday is the day many consumers most like to shop.
�����Bill then insisted on something extraordinary: He would invest $11 million of his own money to build the Boise store and would sell it to Berkshire at cost (without interest!) if the venture succeeded.  If it failed, Bill would keep the store and eat the loss on its disposal.  As I told you in the 1999 annual report, the store immediately became a huge success � and it has since grown.
�����Shortly after the Boise opening, Bill suggested we try Las Vegas, and this time I was even more skeptical.  How could we do business in a metropolis of that size and be closed on Sundays, a day that all of our competitors would be exploiting?  Buoyed by the Boise experience, however, we proceeded to locate in Henderson, a mushrooming city adjacent to Las Vegas.
�����The result: This store outsells all others in the R.C. Willey chain, doing a volume of business that far exceeds the volume of any competitor and that is twice what I had anticipated.  I cut the ribbon at the grand opening in October � this was after a "soft" opening and a few weeks of exceptional sales � and, just as I did at Boise, I suggested to the crowd that the new store was my idea.
�����It didn�t work.  Today, when I pontificate about retailing, Berkshire people just say, "What does Bill think?"  (I�m going to draw the line, however, if he suggests that we also close on Saturdays.)
The Economics of Property/Casualty Insurance
�����Our main business � though we have others of great importance � is insurance.  To understand Berkshire, therefore, it is necessary that you understand how to evaluate an insurance company.  The key determinants are: (1) the amount of float that the business generates; (2) its cost; and (3) most critical of all, the long-term outlook for both of these factors.
�����To begin with, float is money we hold but don't own.  In an insurance operation, float arises because premiums are received before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes extends over many years.  During that time, the insurer invests the money.  This pleasant activity typically carries with it a downside: The premiums that an insurer takes in usually do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay.  That leaves it running an "underwriting loss," which is the cost of float.  An insurance business has value if its cost of float over time is less than the cost the company would otherwise incur to obtain funds.  But the business is a lemon if its cost of float is higher than market rates for money.
�����Historically, Berkshire has obtained its float at a very low cost.  Indeed, our cost has been less than zero in about half of the years in which we've operated; that is, we've actually been paid for holding other people's money.  Over the last few years, however, our cost has been too high, and in 2001 it was terrible.
�����The table that follows shows (at intervals) the float generated by the various segments of Berkshire's insurance operations since we entered the business 35 years ago upon acquiring National Indemnity Company (whose traditional lines are included in the segment "Other Primary").  For the table we have calculated our float � which we generate in large amounts relative to our premium volume � by adding net loss reserves, loss adjustment reserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned premium reserves, and then subtracting insurance-related receivables, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid taxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance.  (Got that?)

�����Last year I told you that, barring a mega-catastrophe, our cost of float would probably drop from its 2000 level of 6%.  I had in mind natural catastrophes when I said that, but instead we were hit by a man-made catastrophe on September 11th � an event that delivered the insurance industry its largest loss in history.  Our float cost therefore came in at a staggering 12.8%.  It was our worst year in float cost since 1984, and a result that to a significant degree, as I will explain in the next section, we brought upon ourselves.
�����If no mega-catastrophe occurs, I � once again � expect the cost of our float to be low in the coming year.  We will indeed need a low cost, as will all insurers.  Some years back, float costing, say, 4% was tolerable because government bonds yielded twice as much, and stocks prospectively offered still loftier returns.  Today, fat returns are nowhere to be found (at least we can't find them) and short-term funds earn less than 2%.  Under these conditions, each of our insurance operations, save one, must deliver an underwriting profit if it is to be judged a good business.  The exception is our retroactive reinsurance operation (a business we explained in last year's annual report), which has desirable economics even though it currently hits us with an annual underwriting loss of about $425 million.
Principles of Insurance Underwriting
�����When property/casualty companies are judged by their cost of float, very few stack up as satisfactory businesses.  And interestingly � unlike the situation prevailing in many other industries � neither size nor brand name determines an insurer's profitability.  Indeed, many of the biggest and best-known companies regularly deliver mediocre results.  What counts in this business is underwriting discipline.  The winners are those that unfailingly stick to three key principles:

They accept only those risks that they are able to properly evaluate (staying within their circle of competence) and that, after they have evaluated all relevant factors including remote loss scenarios, carry the expectancy of profit.  These insurers ignore market-share considerations and are sanguine about losing business to competitors that are offering foolish prices or policy conditions.
They limit the business they accept in a manner that guarantees they will suffer no aggregation of losses from a single event or from related events that will threaten their solvency.  They ceaselessly search for possible correlation among seemingly-unrelated risks.
They avoid business involving moral risk: No matter what the rate, trying to write good contracts with bad people doesn't work.  While most policyholders and clients are honorable and ethical, doing business with the few exceptions is usually expensive, sometimes extraordinarily so.
�����The events of September 11th made it clear that our implementation of rules 1 and 2 at General Re had been dangerously weak.  In setting prices and also in evaluating aggregation risk, we had either overlooked or dismissed the possibility of large-scale terrorism losses.  That was a relevant underwriting factor, and we ignored it.
�����In pricing property coverages, for example, we had looked to the past and taken into account only costs we might expect to incur from windstorm, fire, explosion and earthquake.  But what will be the largest insured property loss in history (after adding related business-interruption claims) originated from none of these forces.  In short, all of us in the industry made a fundamental underwriting mistake by focusing on experience, rather than exposure, thereby assuming a huge terrorism risk for which we received no premium. 
�����Experience, of course, is a highly useful starting point in underwriting most coverages.  For example, it's important for insurers writing California earthquake policies to know how many quakes in the state during the past century have registered 6.0 or greater on the Richter scale.  This information will not tell you the exact probability of a big quake next year, or where in the state it might happen.  But the statistic has utility, particularly if you are writing a huge statewide policy, as National Indemnity has done in recent years.
�����At certain times, however, using experience as a guide to pricing is not only useless, but actually dangerous.  Late in a bull market, for example, large losses from directors and officers liability insurance ("D&O") are likely to be relatively rare.  When stocks are rising, there are a scarcity of targets to sue, and both questionable accounting and management chicanery often go undetected.  At that juncture, experience on high-limit D&O may look great.
�����But that's just when exposure is likely to be exploding, by way of ridiculous public offerings, earnings manipulation, chain-letter-like stock promotions and a potpourri of other unsavory activities.  When stocks fall, these sins surface, hammering investors with losses that can run into the hundreds of billions.  Juries deciding whether those losses should be borne by small investors or big insurance companies can be expected to hit insurers with verdicts that bear little relation to those delivered in bull-market days.  Even one jumbo judgment, moreover, can cause settlement costs in later cases to mushroom.  Consequently, the correct rate for D&O "excess" (meaning the insurer or reinsurer will pay losses above a high threshold) might well, if based on exposure, be five or more times the premium dictated by experience.
�����Insurers have always found it costly to ignore new exposures.  Doing that in the case of terrorism, however, could literally bankrupt the industry.  No one knows the probability of a nuclear detonation in a major metropolis this year (or even multiple detonations, given that a terrorist organization able to construct one bomb might not stop there).  Nor can anyone, with assurance, assess the probability in this year, or another, of deadly biological or chemical agents being introduced simultaneously (say, through ventilation systems) into multiple office buildings and manufacturing plants.  An attack like that would produce astronomical workers' compensation claims.
�����Here's what we do know: 

The probability of such mind-boggling disasters, though likely very low at present, is not zero. 
The probabilities are increasing, in an irregular and immeasurable manner, as knowledge and materials become available to those who wish us ill.  Fear may recede with time, but the danger won't � the war against terrorism can never be won.  The best the nation can achieve is a long succession of stalemates.  There can be no checkmate against hydra-headed foes. 
Until now, insurers and reinsurers have blithely assumed the financial consequences from the incalculable risks I have described. 
Under a "close-to-worst-case" scenario, which could conceivably involve $1 trillion of damage, the insurance industry would be destroyed unless it manages in some manner to dramatically limit its assumption of terrorism risks.  Only the U.S. Government has the resources to absorb such a blow.  If it is unwilling to do so on a prospective basis, the general citizenry must bear its own risks and count on the Government to come to its rescue after a disaster occurs.
�����Why, you might ask, didn't I recognize the above facts before September 11th?  The answer, sadly, is that I did � but I didn't convert thought into action.  I violated the Noah rule: Predicting rain doesn't count; building arks does.  I consequently let Berkshire operate with a dangerous level of risk � at General Re in particular.  I'm sorry to say that much risk for which we haven't been compensated remains on our books, but it is running off by the day.
�����At Berkshire, it should be noted, we have for some years been willing to assume more risk than any other insurer has knowingly taken on.  That's still the case.  We are perfectly willing to lose $2 billion to $2� billion in a single event (as we did on September 11th) if we have been paid properly for assuming the risk that caused the loss (which on that occasion we weren't).
�����Indeed, we have a major competitive advantage because of our tolerance for huge losses.  Berkshire has massive liquid resources, substantial non-insurance earnings, a favorable tax position and a knowledgeable shareholder constituency willing to accept volatility in earnings.  This unique combination enables us to assume risks that far exceed the appetite of even our largest competitors.  Over time, insuring these jumbo risks should be profitable, though periodically they will bring on a terrible year.
�����The bottom-line today is that we will write some coverage for terrorist-related losses, including a few non-correlated policies with very large limits.  But we will not knowingly expose Berkshire to losses beyond what we can comfortably handle.  We will control our total exposure, no matter what the competition does.
Insurance Operations in 2001
�����Over the years, our insurance business has provided ever-growing, low-cost funds that have fueled much of Berkshire's growth.  Charlie and I believe this will continue to be the case.  But we stumbled in a big way in 2001, largely because of underwriting losses at General Re.
�����In the past I have assured you that General Re was underwriting with discipline � and I have been proven wrong.  Though its managers' intentions were good, the company broke each of the three underwriting rules I set forth in the last section and has paid a huge price for doing so.  One obvious cause for its failure is that it did not reserve correctly � more about this in the next section � and therefore severely miscalculated the cost of the product it was selling.  Not knowing your costs will cause problems in any business.  In long-tail reinsurance, where years of unawareness will promote and prolong severe underpricing, ignorance of true costs is dynamite.
�����Additionally, General Re was overly-competitive in going after, and retaining, business.  While all concerned may intend to underwrite with care, it is nonetheless difficult for able, hard-driving professionals to curb their urge to prevail over competitors.  If "winning," however, is equated with market share rather than profits, trouble awaits.  "No" must be an important part of any underwriter's vocabulary.
�����At the risk of sounding Pollyannaish, I now assure you that underwriting discipline is being restored at General Re (and its Cologne Re subsidiary) with appropriate urgency.  Joe Brandon was appointed General Re's CEO in September and, along with Tad Montross, its new president, is committed to producing underwriting profits.  Last fall, Charlie and I read Jack Welch's terrific book, Jack, Straight from the Gut (get a copy!).  In discussing it, we agreed that Joe has many of Jack's characteristics: He is smart, energetic, hands-on, and expects much of both himself and his organization.
�����When it was an independent company, General Re often shone, and now it also has the considerable strengths Berkshire brings to the table.  With that added advantage and with underwriting discipline restored, General Re should be a huge asset for Berkshire.  I predict that Joe and Tad will make it so.

�����At the National Indemnity reinsurance operation, Ajit Jain continues to add enormous value to Berkshire.  Working with only 18 associates, Ajit manages one of the world's largest reinsurance operations measured by assets, and the largest, based upon the size of individual risks assumed.
�����I have known the details of almost every policy that Ajit has written since he came with us in 1986, and never on even a single occasion have I seen him break any of our three underwriting rules.  His extraordinary discipline, of course, does not eliminate losses; it does, however, prevent foolish losses.  And that's the key: Just as is the case in investing, insurers produce outstanding long-term results primarily by avoiding dumb decisions, rather than by making brilliant ones.
�����Since September 11th, Ajit has been particularly busy.  Among the policies we have written and retained entirely for our own account are (1) $578 million of property coverage for a South American refinery once a loss there exceeds $1 billion; (2) $1 billion of non-cancelable third-party liability coverage for losses arising from acts of terrorism at several large international airlines; (3) �500 million of property coverage on a large North Sea oil platform, covering losses from terrorism and sabotage, above �600 million that the insured retained or reinsured elsewhere; and (4) significant coverage on the Sears Tower, including losses caused by terrorism, above a $500 million threshold.  We have written many other jumbo risks as well, such as protection for the World Cup Soccer Tournament and the 2002 Winter Olympics.  In all cases, however, we have attempted to avoid writing groups of policies from which losses might seriously aggregate.  We will not, for example, write coverages on a large number of office and apartment towers in a single metropolis without excluding losses from both a nuclear explosion and the fires that would follow it.
�����No one can match the speed with which Ajit can offer huge policies.  After September 11th, his quickness to respond, always important, has become a major competitive advantage.  So, too, has our unsurpassed financial strength.  Some reinsurers � particularly those who, in turn, are accustomed to laying off much of their business on a second layer of reinsurers known as retrocessionaires � are in a weakened condition and would have difficulty surviving a second mega-cat.  When a daisy chain of retrocessionaires exists, a single weak link can pose trouble for all.  In assessing the soundness of their reinsurance protection, insurers must therefore apply a stress test to all participants in the chain, and must contemplate a catastrophe loss occurring during a very unfavorable economic environment.  After all, you only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.  At Berkshire, we retain our risks and depend on no one.  And whatever the world's problems, our checks will clear.
�����Ajit's business will ebb and flow � but his underwriting principles won't waver.  It's impossible to overstate his value to Berkshire.

�����GEICO, by far our largest primary insurer, made major progress in 2001, thanks to Tony Nicely, its CEO, and his associates.  Quite simply, Tony is an owner's dream.
�����GEICO's premium volume grew 6.6% last year, its float grew $308 million, and it achieved an underwriting profit of $221 million.  This means we were actually paid that amount last year to hold the $4.25 billion in float, which of course doesn't belong to Berkshire but can be used by us for investment.
�����The only disappointment at GEICO in 2001 � and it's an important one � was our inability to add policyholders.  Our preferred customers (81% of our total) grew by 1.6% but our standard and non-standard policies fell by 10.1%.  Overall, policies in force fell .8%.
�����New business has improved in recent months.  Our closure rate from telephone inquiries has climbed, and our Internet business continues its steady growth.  We, therefore, expect at least a modest gain in policy count during 2002.  Tony and I are eager to commit much more to marketing than the $219 million we spent last year, but at the moment we cannot see how to do so effectively.  In the meantime, our operating costs are low and far below those of our major competitors; our prices are attractive; and our float is cost-free and growing.
* * * * * * * * * * * *
�����Our other primary insurers delivered their usual fine results last year.  These operations, run by Rod Eldred, John Kizer, Tom Nerney, Michael Stearns, Don Towle and Don Wurster had combined premium volume of $579 million, up 40% over 2000.  Their float increased 14.5% to $685 million, and they recorded an underwriting profit of $30 million.  In aggregate, these companies are one of the finest insurance operations in the country, and their 2002 prospects look excellent.
 "Loss Development" and Insurance Accounting
�����Bad terminology is the enemy of good thinking.  When companies or investment professionals use terms such as "EBITDA" and "pro forma," they want you to unthinkingly accept concepts that are dangerously flawed.  (In golf, my score is frequently below par on a pro forma basis: I have firm plans to "restructure" my putting stroke and therefore only count the swings I take before reaching the green.)
�����In insurance reporting, "loss development" is a widely used term � and one that is seriously misleading.  First, a definition: Loss reserves at an insurer are not funds tucked away for a rainy day, but rather a liability account.  If properly calculated, the liability states the amount that an insurer will have to pay for all losses (including associated costs) that have occurred prior to the reporting date but have not yet been paid.  When calculating the reserve, the insurer will have been notified of many of the losses it is destined to pay, but others will not yet have been reported to it.  These losses are called IBNR, for incurred but not reported.  Indeed, in some cases (involving, say, product liability or embezzlement) the insured itself will not yet be aware that a loss has occurred.
�����It's clearly difficult for an insurer to put a figure on the ultimate cost of all such reported and unreported events.  But the ability to do so with reasonable accuracy is vital.  Otherwise the insurer's managers won't know what its actual loss costs are and how these compare to the premiums being charged.  GEICO got into huge trouble in the early 1970s because for several years it severely underreserved, and therefore believed its product (insurance protection) was costing considerably less than was truly the case.  Consequently, the company sailed blissfully along, underpricing its product and selling more and more policies at ever-larger losses.
�����When it becomes evident that reserves at past reporting dates understated the liability that truly existed at the time, companies speak of "loss development."  In the year discovered, these shortfalls penalize reported earnings because the "catch-up" costs from prior years must be added to current-year costs when results are calculated.  This is what happened at General Re in 2001: a staggering $800 million of loss costs that actually occurred in earlier years, but that were not then recorded, were belatedly recognized last year and charged against current earnings.  The mistake was an honest one, I can assure you of that.  Nevertheless, for several years, this underreserving caused us to believe that our costs were much lower than they truly were, an error that contributed to woefully inadequate pricing.  Additionally, the overstated profit figures led us to pay substantial incentive compensation that we should not have and to incur income taxes far earlier than was necessary.
�����We recommend scrapping the term "loss development" and its equally ugly twin, "reserve strengthening."  (Can you imagine an insurer, upon finding its reserves excessive, describing the reduction that follows as "reserve weakening"?)  "Loss development" suggests to investors that some natural, uncontrollable event has occurred in the current year, and "reserve strengthening" implies that adequate amounts have been further buttressed.  The truth, however, is that management made an error in estimation that in turn produced an error in the earnings previously reported.  The losses didn't "develop" � they were there all along.  What developed was management's understanding of the losses (or, in the instances of chicanery, management's willingness to finally fess up).
�����A more forthright label for the phenomenon at issue would be "loss costs we failed to recognize when they occurred" (or maybe just "oops").  Underreserving, it should be noted, is a common � and serious � problem throughout the property/casualty insurance industry.  At Berkshire we told you of our own problems with underestimation in 1984 and 1986.  Generally, however, our reserving has been conservative.
�����Major underreserving is common in cases of companies struggling for survival.  In effect, insurance accounting is a self-graded exam, in that the insurer gives some figures to its auditing firm and generally doesn't get an argument.  (What the auditor gets, however, is a letter from management that is designed to take his firm off the hook if the numbers later look silly.)  A company experiencing financial difficulties � of a kind that, if truly faced, could put it out of business � seldom proves to be a tough grader.  Who, after all, wants to prepare his own execution papers?
�����Even when companies have the best of intentions, it's not easy to reserve properly.  I've told the story in the past about the fellow traveling abroad whose sister called to tell him that their dad had died.  The brother replied that it was impossible for him to get home for the funeral; he volunteered, however, to shoulder its cost.  Upon returning, the brother received a bill from the mortuary for $4,500, which he promptly paid.  A month later, and a month after that also, he paid $10 pursuant to an add-on invoice.  When a third $10 invoice came, he called his sister for an explanation.  "Oh," she replied, "I forgot to tell you.  We buried dad in a rented suit."
�����There are a lot of "rented suits" buried in the past operations of insurance companies.  Sometimes the problems they signify lie dormant for decades, as was the case with asbestos liability, before virulently manifesting themselves.  Difficult as the job may be, it's management's responsibility to adequately account for all possibilities.  Conservatism is essential.  When a claims manager walks into the CEO's office and says "Guess what just happened," his boss, if a veteran, does not expect to hear it's good news.  Surprises in the insurance world have been far from symmetrical in their effect on earnings.
�����Because of this one-sided experience, it is folly to suggest, as some are doing, that all property/casualty insurance reserves be discounted, an approach reflecting the fact that they will be paid in the future and that therefore their present value is less than the stated liability for them.  Discounting might be acceptable if reserves could be precisely established.  They can't, however, because a myriad of forces � judicial broadening of policy language and medical inflation, to name just two chronic problems � are constantly working to make reserves inadequate.  Discounting would exacerbate this already-serious situation and, additionally, would provide a new tool for the companies that are inclined to fudge.
�����I'd say that the effects from telling a profit-challenged insurance CEO to lower reserves through discounting would be comparable to those that would ensue if a father told his 16-year-old son to have a normal sex life.  Neither party needs that kind of push.
Sources of Reported Earnings
�����The table that follows shows the main sources of Berkshire's reported earnings.  In this presentation, purchase-accounting adjustments (primarily relating to "goodwill") are not assigned to the specific businesses to which they apply, but are instead aggregated and shown separately.  This procedure lets you view the earnings of our businesses as they would have been reported had we not purchased them.  In recent years, our "expense" for goodwill amortization has been large.  Going forward, generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") will no longer require amortization of goodwill.  This change will increase our reported earnings (though not our true economic earnings) and simplify this section of the report.

(1) Includes Acme Brick from August 1, 2000; Benjamin Moore from December 18, 2000; Johns Manville from February 27, 2001; and MiTek from July 31, 2001.
(2) From date of acquisition, January 8, 2001.

�����Here are some highlights (and lowlights) from 2001 relating to our non-insurance activities: 

Our shoe operations (included in "other businesses") lost $46.2 million pre-tax, with profits at H.H. Brown and Justin swamped by losses at Dexter.
I've made three decisions relating to Dexter that have hurt you in a major way:  (1) buying it in the first place; (2) paying for it with stock and (3) procrastinating when the need for changes in its operations was obvious.  I would like to lay these mistakes on Charlie (or anyone else, for that matter) but they were mine.  Dexter, prior to our purchase � and indeed for a few years after � prospered despite low-cost foreign competition that was brutal.  I concluded that Dexter could continue to cope with that problem, and I was wrong.
We have now placed the Dexter operation � which is still substantial in size � under the management of Frank Rooney and Jim Issler at H.H. Brown.  These men have performed outstandingly for Berkshire, skillfully contending with the extraordinary changes that have bedeviled the footwear industry.  During part of 2002, Dexter will be hurt by unprofitable sales commitments it made last year.  After that, we believe our shoe business will be reasonably profitable.
MidAmerican Energy, of which we own 76% on a fully-diluted basis, had a good year in 2001.  Its reported earnings should also increase considerably in 2002 given that the company has been shouldering a large charge for the amortization of goodwill and that this "cost" will disappear under the new GAAP rules.
Last year MidAmerican swapped some properties in England, adding Yorkshire Electric, with its 2.1 million customers.  We are now serving 3.6 million customers in the U.K. and are its 2nd largest electric utility.  We have an equally important operation in Iowa as well as major generating facilities in California and the Philippines.
At MidAmerican � this may surprise you � we also own the second-largest residential real estate brokerage business in the country.  We are market-share leaders in a number of large cities, primarily in the Midwest, and have recently acquired important firms in Atlanta and Southern California.  Last year, operating under various names that are locally familiar, we handled about 106,000 transactions involving properties worth nearly $20 billion.  Ron Peltier has built this business for us, and it's likely he will make more acquisitions in 2002 and the years to come.
Considering the recessionary environment plaguing them, our retailing operations did well in 2001.  In jewelry, same-store sales fell 7.6% and pre-tax margins were 8.9% versus 10.7% in 2000.  Return on invested capital remains high.
Same-store sales at our home-furnishings retailers were unchanged and so was the margin � 9.1% pre-tax � these operations earned.  Here, too, return on invested capital is excellent.
We continue to expand in both jewelry and home-furnishings.  Of particular note, Nebraska Furniture Mart is constructing a mammoth 450,000 square foot store that will serve the greater Kansas City area beginning in the fall of 2003.  Despite Bill Child's counter-successes, we will keep this store open on Sundays.
The large acquisitions we initiated in late 2000 � Shaw, Johns Manville and Benjamin Moore � all came through their first year with us in great fashion.  Charlie and I knew at the time of our purchases that we were in good hands with Bob Shaw, Jerry Henry and Yvan Dupuy, respectively � and we admire their work even more now.  Together these businesses earned about $659 million pre-tax.
Shortly after yearend we exchanged 4,740 Berkshire A shares (or their equivalent in B shares) for the 12.7% minority interest in Shaw, which means we now own 100% of the company.  Shaw is our largest non-insurance operation and will play a big part in Berkshire's future.
All of the income shown for Flight Services in 2001 � and a bit more � came from FlightSafety, our pilot-training subsidiary.  Its earnings increased 2.5%, though return on invested capital fell slightly because of the $258 million investment we made last year in simulators and other fixed assets.  My 84-year-old friend, Al Ueltschi, continues to run FlightSafety with the same enthusiasm and competitive spirit that he has exhibited since 1951, when he invested $10,000 to start the company.  If I line Al up with a bunch of 60-year-olds at the annual meeting, you will not be able to pick him out.
After September 11th, training for commercial airlines fell, and today it remains depressed.  However, training for business and general aviation, our main activity, is at near-normal levels and should continue to grow.  In 2002, we expect to spend $162 million for 27 simulators, a sum far in excess of our annual depreciation charge of $95 million.  Those who believe that EBITDA is in any way equivalent to true earnings are welcome to pick up the tab.
Our NetJets� fractional ownership program sold a record number of planes last year and also showed a gain of 21.9% in service income from management fees and hourly charges.  Nevertheless, it operated at a small loss, versus a small profit in 2000.  We made a little money in the U.S., but these earnings were more than offset by European losses.  Measured by the value of our customers' planes, NetJets accounts for about half of the industry.  We believe the other participants, in aggregate, lost significant money.
Maintaining a premier level of safety, security and service was always expensive, and the cost of sticking to those standards was exacerbated by September 11th.  No matter how much the cost, we will continue to be the industry leader in all three respects.  An uncompromising insistence on delivering only the best to his customers is embedded in the DNA of Rich Santulli, CEO of the company and the inventor of fractional ownership.  I'm delighted with his fanaticism on these matters for both the company's sake and my family's: I believe the Buffetts fly more fractional-ownership hours � we log in excess of 800 annually � than does any other family.  In case you're wondering, we use exactly the same planes and crews that serve NetJet's other customers.
NetJets experienced a spurt in new orders shortly after September 11th, but its sales pace has since returned to normal.  Per-customer usage declined somewhat during the year, probably because of the recession.
Both we and our customers derive significant operational benefits from our being the runaway leader in the fractional ownership business.  We have more than 300 planes constantly on the go in the U.S. and can therefore be wherever a customer needs us on very short notice.  The ubiquity of our fleet also reduces our "positioning" costs below those incurred by operators with smaller fleets.
These advantages of scale, and others we have, give NetJets a significant economic edge over competition.  Under the competitive conditions likely to prevail for a few years, however, our advantage will at best produce modest profits.
Our finance and financial products line of business now includes XTRA, General Re Securities (which is in a run-off mode that will continue for an extended period) and a few other relatively small operations.  The bulk of the assets and liabilities in this segment, however, arise from a few fixed-income strategies, involving highly-liquid AAA securities, that I manage.  This activity, which only makes sense when certain market relationships exist, has produced good returns in the past and has reasonable prospects for continuing to do so over the next year or two.

�����We made few changes in our portfolio during 2001.  As a group, our larger holdings have performed poorly in the last few years, some because of disappointing operating results.  Charlie and I still like the basic businesses of all the companies we own.  But we do not believe Berkshire's equity holdings as a group are undervalued.
�����Our restrained enthusiasm for these securities is matched by decidedly lukewarm feelings about the prospects for stocks in general over the next decade or so.  I expressed my views about equity returns in a speech I gave at an Allen and Company meeting in July (which was a follow-up to a similar presentation I had made two years earlier) and an edited version of my comments appeared in a December 10th Fortune article.  I'm enclosing a copy of that article.  You can also view the Fortune version of my 1999 talk at our website www.berkshirehathaway.com.
�����Charlie and I believe that American business will do fine over time but think that today's equity prices presage only moderate returns for investors.  The market outperformed business for a very long period, and that phenomenon had to end.  A market that no more than parallels business progress, however, is likely to leave many investors disappointed, particularly those relatively new to the game.
�����Here's one for those who enjoy an odd coincidence: The Great Bubble ended on March 10, 2000 (though we didn't realize that fact until some months later).  On that day, the NASDAQ (recently 1,731) hit its all-time high of 5,132.  That same day, Berkshire shares traded at $40,800, their lowest price since mid-1997.
* * * * * * * * * * * *
�����During 2001, we were somewhat more active than usual in "junk" bonds.  These are not, we should emphasize, suitable investments for the general public, because too often these securities live up to their name.  We have never purchased a newly-issued junk bond, which is the only kind most investors are urged to buy.  When losses occur in this field, furthermore, they are often disastrous: Many issues end up at a small fraction of their original offering price and some become entirely worthless.
�����Despite these dangers, we periodically find a few � a very few � junk securities that are interesting to us.  And, so far, our 50-year experience in distressed debt has proven rewarding.  In our 1984 annual report, we described our purchases of Washington Public Power System bonds when that issuer fell into disrepute.  We've also, over the years, stepped into other apparent calamities such as Chrysler Financial, Texaco and RJR Nabisco � all of which returned to grace.  Still, if we stay active in junk bonds, you can expect us to have losses from time to time.
�����Occasionally, a purchase of distressed bonds leads us into something bigger.  Early in the Fruit of the Loom bankruptcy, we purchased the company's public and bank debt at about 50% of face value.  This was an unusual bankruptcy in that interest payments on senior debt were continued without interruption, which meant we earned about a 15% current return.  Our holdings grew to 10% of Fruit's senior debt, which will probably end up returning us about 70% of face value.  Through this investment, we indirectly reduced our purchase price for the whole company by a small amount.
�����In late 2000, we began purchasing the obligations of FINOVA Group, a troubled finance company, and that, too, led to our making a major transaction.  FINOVA then had about $11 billion of debt outstanding, of which we purchased 13% at about two-thirds of face value.  We expected the company to go into bankruptcy, but believed that liquidation of its assets would produce a payoff for creditors that would be well above our cost.  As default loomed in early 2001, we joined forces with Leucadia National Corporation to present the company with a prepackaged plan for bankruptcy.
�����The plan as subsequently modified (and I'm simplifying here) provided that creditors would be paid 70% of face value (along with full interest) and that they would receive a newly-issued 7�% note for the 30% of their claims not satisfied by cash.  To fund FINOVA's 70% distribution, Leucadia and Berkshire formed a jointly-owned entity � mellifluently christened Berkadia � that borrowed $5.6 billion through FleetBoston and, in turn, re-lent this sum to FINOVA, concurrently obtaining a priority claim on its assets.  Berkshire guaranteed 90% of the Berkadia borrowing and also has a secondary guarantee on the 10% for which Leucadia has primary responsibility.  (Did I mention that I am simplifying?).

�����There is a spread of about two percentage points between what Berkadia pays on its borrowing and what it receives from FINOVA, with this spread flowing 90% to Berkshire and 10% to Leucadia.  As I write this, each loan has been paid down to $3.9 billion.
�����As part of the bankruptcy plan, which was approved on August 10, 2001, Berkshire also agreed to offer 70% of face value for up to $500 million principal amount of the $3.25 billion of new 7�% bonds that were issued by FINOVA.  (Of these, we had already received $426.8 million in principal amount because of our 13% ownership of the original debt.)  Our offer, which was to run until September 26, 2001, could be withdrawn under a variety of conditions, one of which became operative if the New York Stock Exchange closed during the offering period.   When that indeed occurred in the week of September 11th, we promptly terminated the offer.
�����Many of FINOVA's loans involve aircraft assets whose values were significantly diminished by the events of September 11th.  Other receivables held by the company also were imperiled by the economic consequences of the attack that day.  FINOVA's prospects, therefore, are not as good as when we made our proposal to the bankruptcy court.  Nevertheless we feel that overall the transaction will prove satisfactory for Berkshire.  Leucadia has day-to-day operating responsibility for FINOVA, and we have long been impressed with the business acumen and managerial talent of its key executives.

* * * * * * * * * * * *

�����It's d�j� vu time again: In early 1965, when the investment partnership I ran took control of Berkshire, that company had its main banking relationships with First National Bank of Boston and a large New York City bank.  Previously, I had done no business with either.
�����Fast forward to 1969, when I wanted Berkshire to buy the Illinois National Bank and Trust of Rockford.  We needed $10 million, and I contacted both banks.  There was no response from New York.  However, two representatives of the Boston bank immediately came to Omaha.  They told me they would supply the money for our purchase and that we would work out the details later.
�����For the next three decades, we borrowed almost nothing from banks.  (Debt is a four-letter word around Berkshire.)  Then, in February, when we were structuring the FINOVA transaction, I again called Boston, where First National had morphed into FleetBoston.  Chad Gifford, the company's president, responded just as Bill Brown and Ira Stepanian had back in 1969 � "you've got the money and we'll work out the details later."
�����And that's just what happened.  FleetBoston syndicated a loan for $6 billion (as it turned out, we didn't need $400 million of it), and it was quickly oversubscribed by 17 banks throughout the world.  Sooooo . . . if you ever need $6 billion, just give Chad a call � assuming, that is, your credit is AAA.

* * * * * * * * * * * *

�����One more point about our investments: The media often report that "Buffett is buying" this or that security, having picked up the "fact" from reports that Berkshire files.  These accounts are sometimes correct, but at other times the transactions Berkshire reports are actually being made by Lou Simpson, who runs a $2 billion portfolio for GEICO that is quite independent of me.  Normally, Lou does not tell me what he is buying or selling, and I learn of his activities only when I look at a GEICO portfolio summary that I receive a few days after the end of each month.  Lou's thinking, of course, is quite similar to mine, but we usually end up in different securities.  That's largely because he's working with less money and can therefore invest in smaller companies than I.  Oh, yes, there's also another minor difference between us: In recent years, Lou's performance has been far better than mine.

Charitable Contributions

�����Berkshire follows a highly unusual policy in respect to charitable contributions � but it's one that Charlie and I believe is both rational and fair to owners.
�����First, we let our operating subsidiaries make their own charitable decisions, requesting only that the owners/managers who once ran these as independent companies make all donations to their personal charities from their own funds, instead of using company money.  When our managers are using company funds, we trust them to make gifts in a manner that delivers commensurate tangible or intangible benefits to the operations they manage.  Last year contributions from Berkshire subsidiaries totaled $19.2 million.
�����At the parent company level, we make no contributions except those designated by shareholders.  We do not match contributions made by directors or employees, nor do we give to the favorite charities of the Buffetts or the Mungers.  However, prior to our purchasing them, a few of our subsidiaries had employee-match programs and we feel fine about their continuing them: It's not our style to tamper with successful business cultures.
�����To implement our owners' charitable desires, each year we notify registered holders of A shares (A's represent 86.6% of our equity capital) of a per-share amount that they can instruct us to contribute to as many as three charities.  Shareholders name the charity; Berkshire writes the check.  Any organization that qualifies under the Internal Revenue Code can be designated by shareholders.  Last year Berkshire made contributions of $16.7 million at the direction of 5,700 shareholders, who named 3,550 charities as recipients.  Since we started this program, our shareholders' gifts have totaled $181 million.
�����Most public corporations eschew gifts to religious institutions.  These, however, are favorite charities of our shareholders, who last year named 437 churches and synagogues to receive gifts.  Additionally, 790 schools were recipients.  A few of our larger shareholders, including Charlie and me, designate their personal foundations to get gifts, so that those entities can, in turn, disburse their funds widely.
�����I get a few letters every week criticizing Berkshire for contributing to Planned Parenthood.  These letters are usually prompted by an organization that wishes to see boycotts of Berkshire products.  The letters are invariably polite and sincere, but their writers are unaware of a key point: It's not Berkshire, but rather its owners who are making charitable decisions � and these owners are about as diverse in their opinions as you can imagine.  For example, they are probably on both sides of the abortion issue in roughly the same proportion as the American population.  We'll follow their instructions, whether they designate Planned Parenthood or Metro Right to Life, just as long as the charity possesses 501(c)(3) status.  It's as if we paid a dividend, which the shareholder then donated.  Our form of disbursement, however, is more tax-efficient.
�����In neither the purchase of goods nor the hiring of personnel, do we ever consider the religious views, the gender, the race or the sexual orientation of the persons we are dealing with.  It would not only be wrong to do so, it would be idiotic.  We need all of the talent we can find, and we have learned that able and trustworthy managers, employees and suppliers come from a very wide spectrum of humanity.

* * * * * * * * * * *

�����To participate in our future charitable contribution programs, you must own Class A shares that are registered in the name of the actual owner, not the nominee name of a broker, bank or depository.  Shares not so registered on August 31, 2002 will be ineligible for the 2002 program.  When you get the contributions form from us, return it promptly.  Designations received after the due date will not be honored. 

The Annual Meeting
�����This year's annual meeting will be on Saturday, May 4, and we will again be at the Civic Auditorium.  The doors will open at 7 a.m., the movie will begin at 8:30, and the meeting itself will commence at 9:30.  There will be a short break at noon for food.  (Sandwiches can be bought at the Civic's concession stands.)  Except for that interlude, Charlie and I will answer questions until 3:30.  Give us your best shot.
�����For at least the next year, the Civic, located downtown, is the only site available to us.  We must therefore hold the meeting on either Saturday or Sunday to avoid the traffic and parking nightmare sure to occur on a weekday.  Shortly, however, Omaha will have a new Convention Center with plenty of parking facilities.  Assuming that we then head for the Center, I will poll shareholders to see whether you wish to return to the Monday meeting that was standard until 2000.  We will decide that vote based on a count of shareholders, not shares.  (This is not a system, however, we will ever institute to decide who should be CEO.)
�����An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the credential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events.  As for plane, hotel and car reservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  They do a terrific job for us each year, and I thank them for it.
�����In our usual fashion, we will run buses from the larger hotels to the meeting.  Afterwards, the buses will make trips back to the hotels and to Nebraska Furniture Mart, Borsheim's and the airport.  Even so, you are likely to find a car useful.
�����We have added so many new companies to Berkshire this year that I'm not going to detail all of the products that we will be selling at the meeting.  But come prepared to carry home everything from bricks to candy.  And underwear, of course.  Assuming our Fruit of the Loom purchase has closed by May 4, we will be selling Fruit's latest styles, which will make you your neighborhood's fashion leader.  Buy a lifetime supply.
�����GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of them ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes.  In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a special shareholder discount (usually 8%).  This special offer is permitted by 41 of the 49 jurisdictions in which we operate.  Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money.
�����At the Omaha airport on Saturday, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets� available for your inspection.  Just ask a representative at the Civic about viewing any of these planes.  If you buy what we consider an appropriate number of items during the weekend, you may well need your own plane to take them home.  And, if you buy a fraction of a plane, we might even throw in a three-pack of briefs or boxers.
�����At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 75-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having "Berkshire Weekend" pricing, which means we will be offering our shareholders a discount that is customarily given only to employees.  We initiated this special pricing at NFM five years ago, and sales during the "Weekend" grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $11.5 million in 2001.
�����To get the discount, you must make your purchases on Thursday, May 2 through Monday, May 6 and also present your meeting credential.  The period's special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but that, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you.  We appreciate their cooperation.  NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.
�����Borsheim's �
 the largest jewelry store in the country except for Tiffany's Manhattan store �
 will have two shareholder-only events.  The first will be a cocktail reception from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, May 3.  The second, the main gala, will be from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday, May 5.  Shareholder prices will be available Thursday through Monday, so if you wish to avoid the large crowds that will assemble on Friday evening and Sunday, come at other times and identify yourself as a shareholder.  On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m.  Borsheim's operates on a gross margin that is fully twenty percentage points below that of its major rivals, so the more you buy, the more you save (or at least that's what my wife and daughter tell me).  Come by and let us perform a walletectomy on you.
�����In the mall outside of Borsheim's, we will have some of the world's top bridge experts available to play with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon.  We expect Bob and Petra Hamman along with Sharon Osberg to host tables.  Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, will also be in the mall, taking on all comers �
 blindfolded!  Last year, Patrick played as many as six games simultaneously �
 with his blindfold securely in place �
 and this year will try for seven.  Finally, Bill Robertie, one of only two players who have twice won the backgammon world championship, will be on hand to test your skill at that game.  Come to the mall on Sunday for the Mensa Olympics.
�����Gorat's �
 my favorite steakhouse �
 will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 5, and will be serving from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m.  Please remember that to come to Gorat's on Sunday, you must have a reservation.  To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 1 (but not before).  If Sunday is sold out, try Gorat's on one of the other evenings you will be in town.  Show your sophistication by ordering a rare T-bone with a double order of hash browns.
�����The usual baseball game will be held at Rosenblatt Stadium at 7 p.m. on Saturday night.  This year the Omaha Royals will play the Oklahoma RedHawks.  Last year, in an attempt to emulate the career switch of Babe Ruth, I gave up pitching and tried batting.  Bob Gibson, an Omaha native, was on the mound and I was terrified, fearing Bob's famous brush-back pitch.  Instead, he delivered a fast ball in the strike zone, and with a Mark McGwire-like swing, I managed to connect for a hard grounder, which inexplicably died in the infield.  I didn't run it out: At my age, I get winded playing a hand of bridge.
�����I'm not sure what will take place at the ballpark this year, but come out and be surprised.  Our proxy statement contains instructions for obtaining tickets to the game.  Those people ordering tickets to the annual meeting will receive a booklet containing all manner of information that should help you enjoy your visit in Omaha.  There will be plenty of action in town.  So come for Woodstock Weekend and join our Celebration of Capitalism at the Civic.
* * * * * * * * * * * *
�����Finally, I would like to thank the wonderful and incredibly productive crew at World Headquarters (all 5,246.5 square feet of it) who make my job so easy.  Berkshire added about 40,000 employees last year, bringing our workforce to 110,000.  At headquarters we added one employee and now have 14.8.  (I've tried in vain to get JoEllen Rieck to change her workweek from four days to five; I think she likes the national recognition she gains by being .8.)
�����The smooth handling of the array of duties that come with our current size and scope � as well as some additional activities almost unique to Berkshire, such as our shareholder gala and designated-gifts program � takes a very special group of people.  And that we most definitely have.

Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market
rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire's results
through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculated using
the numbers originally reported.

The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire
were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500
in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P in years when the index showed a
negative retum. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.

To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:

Our gain in net worth during 2002 was $6.1 billion, which increased the per-share book value of
both our Class A and Class B stock by 10.0%. Over the last 38 years (that is, since present management
took over) per-share book value has grown from $19 to $41,727, a rate of 22.2% compounded annually.”

In all respects 2002 was a banner year. I’ll provide details later, but here’s a summary:

° Our various non-insurance operations performed exceptionally well, despite a sluggish economy.
A decade ago Berkshire’s annual pre-tax earnings from our non-insurance businesses was $272
million. Now, from our ever-expanding collection of manufacturing, retailing, service and finance
businesses, we earn that sum monthly.

° Our insurance group increased its float to $41.2 billion, a hefty gain of $5.7 billion. Better yet, the
use of these funds in 2002 cost us only 1%. Getting back to low-cost float feels good, particularly
after our poor results during the three previous years. Berkshire’s reinsurance division and
GEICO shot the lights out in 2002, and underwriting discipline was restored at General Re.

° Berkshire acquired some important new businesses — with economic characteristics ranging from
good to great, run by managers ranging from great to great. Those attributes are two legs of our
“entrance” strategy, the third being a sensible purchase price. Unlike LBO operators and private
equity firms, we have no “exit” strategy — we buy to keep. That’s one reason why Berkshire is
usually the first — and sometimes the only — choice for sellers and their managers.

° Our marketable securities outperformed most indices. For Lou Simpson, who manages equities at
GEICO, this was old stuff. But, for me, it was a welcome change from the last few years, during
which my investment record was dismal.

The confluence of these favorable factors in 2002 caused our book-value gain to outstrip the
performance of the S&P 500 by 32.1 percentage points. This result is aberrational: Charlie Munger,
Berkshire’s vice chairman and my partner, and I hope to achieve — at most — an average annual advantage
of a few points. In the future, there will be years in which the S&P soundly trounces us. That will in fact
almost certainly happen during a strong bull market, because the portion of our assets committed to
common stocks has significantly declined. This change, of course, helps our relative performance in down
markets such as we had in 2002.

I have another caveat to mention about last year’s results. If you’ve been a reader of financial
reports in recent years, you’ve seen a flood of “pro-forma” earnings statements — tabulations in which
managers invariably show “earnings” far in excess of those allowed by their auditors. In these
presentations, the CEO tells his owners “don’t count this, don’t count that — just count what makes earnings
fat.” Often, a forget-all-this-bad-stuff message is delivered year after year without management so much as
blushing.

 

“All figures used in this report apply to Berkshire's A shares, the successor to the only stock that
the company had outstanding before 1996. The B shares have an economic interest equal to 1/30th that of
the A.
We’ve yet to see a pro-forma presentation disclosing that audited earnings were somewhat high.
So let’s make a little history: Last year, on a pro-forma basis, Berkshire had /ower earnings than those we
actually reported.

That is true because two favorable factors aided our reported figures. First, in 2002 there was no
megacatastrophe, which means that Berkshire (and other insurers as well) earned more from insurance than
if losses had been normal. In years when the reverse is true — because of a blockbuster hurricane,
earthquake or man-made disaster — many insurers like to report that they would have earned X “except for”
the unusual event. The implication is that since such megacats are infrequent, they shouldn’t be counted
when “true” earnings are calculated. That is deceptive nonsense. “Except for” losses will forever be part
of the insurance business, and they will forever be paid with shareholders’ money.

Nonetheless, for the purposes of this exercise, we'll take a page from the industry’s book. For last
year, when we didn’t have any truly major disasters, a downward adjustment is appropriate if you wish to
“normalize” our underwriting result.

Secondly, the bond market in 2002 favored certain strategies we employed in our finance and
financial products business. Gains from those strategies will certainly diminish within a year or two — and
may well disappear.

Soooo . . . “except for’ a couple of favorable breaks, our pre-tax earnings last year would have
been about $500 million less than we actually reported. We’re happy, nevertheless, to bank the excess. As
Jack Benny once said upon receiving an award: “I don’t deserve this honor — but, then, I have arthritis, and
I don’t deserve that either.”

We continue to be blessed with an extraordinary group of managers, many of whom haven’t the
slightest financial need to work. They stick around, though: In 38 years, we’ve never had a single CEO of
a subsidiary elect to leave Berkshire to work elsewhere. Counting Charlie, we now have six managers over
75, and I hope that in four years that number increases by at least two (Bob Shaw and I are both 72). Our
rationale: “It’s hard to teach a new dog old tricks.”

Berkshire’s operating CEOs are masters of their crafts and run their businesses as if they were
their own. My job is to stay out of their way and allocate whatever excess capital their businesses generate.
It’s easy work.

My managerial model is Eddie Bennett, who was a batboy. In 1919, at age 19, Eddie began his
work with the Chicago White Sox, who that year went to the World Series. The next year, Eddie switched
to the Brooklyn Dodgers, and they, too, won their league title. Our hero, however, smelled trouble.
Changing boroughs, he joined the Yankees in 1921, and they promptly won their first pennant in history.
Now Eddie settled in, shrewdly seeing what was coming. In the next seven years, the Yankees won five
American League titles.

What does this have to do with management? It’s simple — to be a winner, work with winners. In
1927, for example, Eddie received $700 for the 1/8th World Series share voted him by the legendary
Yankee team of Ruth and Gehrig. This sum, which Eddie earned by working only four days (because New
York swept the Series) was roughly equal to the full-year pay then earned by batboys who worked with
ordinary associates.

Eddie understood that how he lugged bats was unimportant; what counted instead was hooking up
with the cream of those on the playing field. I’ve learned from Eddie. At Berkshire, I regularly hand bats
to many of the heaviest hitters in American business.

Acquisitions

We added some sluggers to our lineup last year. Two acquisitions pending at yearend 2001 were
completed: Albecca (which operates under the name Larson-Juhl), the U.S. leader in custom-made picture
frames; and Fruit of the Loom, the producer of about 33.3% of the men’s and boy’s underwear sold in the
US. and of other apparel as well.
Both companies came with outstanding CEOs: Steve McKenzie at Albecca and John Holland at
Fruit. John, who had retired from Fruit in 1996, rejoined it three years ago and rescued the company from
the disastrous path it had gone down after he’d left. He’s now 70, and I am trying to convince him to make
his next retirement coincident with mine (presently scheduled for five years after my death — a date subject,
however, to extension).

We initiated and completed two other acquisitions last year that were somewhat below our normal
size threshold. In aggregate, however, these businesses earn more than $60 million pre-tax annually. Both
operate in industries characterized by tough economics, but both also have important competitive strengths
that enable them to earn decent returns on capital.

The newcomers are:

(a) CTB, a worldwide leader in equipment for the poultry, hog, egg production and grain
industries; and

(b) Garan, a manufacturer of children’s apparel, whose largest and best-known line is
Garanimals®.

These two companies came with the managers responsible for their impressive records: Vic
Mancinelli at CTB and Seymour Lichtenstein at Garan.

The largest acquisition we initiated in 2002 was The Pampered Chef, a company with a fascinating
history dating back to 1980. Doris Christopher was then a 34-year-old suburban Chicago home economics
teacher with a husband, two little girls, and absolutely no business background. Wanting, however, to
supplement her family’s modest income, she turned to thinking about what she knew best — food
preparation. Why not, she wondered, make a business out of marketing kitchenware, focusing on the items
she herself had found most useful?

To get started, Doris borrowed $3,000 against her life insurance policy — all the money ever
injected into the company — and went to the Merchandise Mart on a buying expedition. There, she picked
up a dozen each of this and that, and then went home to set up operations in her basement.

Her plan was to conduct in-home presentations to small groups of women, gathered at the homes
of their friends. While driving to her first presentation, though, Doris almost talked herself into returning
home, convinced she was doomed to fail.

But the women she faced that evening loved her and her products, purchased $175 of goods, and
TPC was underway. Working with her husband, Jay, Doris did $50,000 of business in the first year.
Today — only 22 years later — TPC does more than $700 million of business annually, working through
67,000 kitchen consultants.

I’ve been to a TPC party, and it’s easy to see why the business is a success. The company’s
products, in large part proprietary, are well-styled and highly useful, and the consultants are knowledgeable
and enthusiastic. Everyone has a good time. Hurry to pamperedchef.com on the Internet to find where to
attend a party near you.

Two years ago, Doris brought in Sheila O’Connell Cooper, now CEO, to share the management
load, and in August they met with me in Omaha. It took me about ten seconds to decide that these were
two managers with whom I wished to partner, and we promptly made a deal. Berkshire shareholders
couldn’t be luckier than to be associated with Doris and Sheila.

2K 2K ok ok Ok ok ok ok ok ok ok Ok

Berkshire also made some important acquisitions last year through MidAmerican Energy Holdings
(MEHC), a company in which our equity interest is 80.2%. Because the Public Utility Holding Company
Act (PUHCA) limits us to 9.9% voting control, however, we are unable to fully consolidate MEHC’s
financial statements.

Despite the voting-control limitation — and the somewhat strange capital structure at MEHC it has
engendered — the company is a key part of Berkshire. Already it has $18 billion of assets and delivers our
largest stream of non-insurance earnings. It could well grow to be huge.
Last year MEHC acquired two important gas pipelines. The first, Kern River, extends from
Southwest Wyoming to Southern California. This line moves about 900 million cubic feet of gas a day and
is undergoing a $1.2 billion expansion that will double throughput by this fall. At that point, the line will
carry enough gas to generate electricity for ten million homes.

The second acquisition, Northern Natural Gas, is a 16,600 mile line extending from the Southwest
to a wide range of Midwestern locations. This purchase completes a corporate odyssey of particular
interest to Omahans.

From its beginnings in the 1930s, Northern Natural was one of Omaha’s premier businesses, run
by CEOs who regularly distinguished themselves as community leaders. Then, in July, 1985, the company
— which in 1980 had been renamed InterNorth — merged with Houston Natural Gas, a business less than
half its size. The companies announced that the enlarged operation would be headquartered in Omaha,
with InterNorth’s CEO continuing in that job.

Within a year, those promises were broken. By then, the former CEO of Houston Natural had
taken over the top job at InterNorth, the company had been renamed, and the headquarters had been moved
to Houston. These switches were orchestrated by the new CEO — Ken Lay — and the name he chose was
Enron.

Fast forward 15 years to late 2001. Enron ran into the troubles we’ve heard so much about and
borrowed money from Dynegy, putting up the Northern Natural pipeline operation as collateral. The two
companies quickly had a falling out, and the pipeline’s ownership moved to Dynegy. That company, in
turn, soon encountered severe financial problems of its own.

MEHC received a call on Friday, July 26, from Dynegy, which was looking for a quick and
certain cash sale of the pipeline. Dynegy phoned the right party: On July 29, we signed a contract, and
shortly thereafter Northern Natural returned home.

When 2001 began, Charlie and I had no idea that Berkshire would be moving into the pipeline
business. But upon completion of the Kern River expansion, MEHC will transport about 8% of all gas
used in the U.S. We continue to look for large energy-related assets, though in the electric utility field

PUHCA constrains what we can do.

A few years ago, and somewhat by accident, MEHC found itself in the residential real estate
brokerage business. It is no accident, however, that we have dramatically expanded the operation.
Moreover, we are likely to keep on expanding in the future.

We call this business HomeServices of America. In the various communities it serves, though, it
operates under the names of the businesses it has acquired, such as CBS in Omaha, Edina Realty in
Minneapolis and Iowa Realty in Des Moines. In most metropolitan areas in which we operate, we are the
clear market leader.

HomeServices is now the second largest residential brokerage business in the country. On one
side or the other (or both), we participated in $37 billion of transactions last year, up 100% from 2001.

Most of our growth came from three acquisitions we made during 2002, the largest of which was
Prudential California Realty. Last year, this company, the leading realtor in a territory consisting of Los
Angeles, Orange and San Diego Counties, participated in $16 billion of closings.

In a very short period, Ron Peltier, the company’s CEO, has increased HomeServices’ revenues —
and profits — dramatically. Though this business will always be cyclical, it’s one we like and in which we
continue to have an appetite for sensible acquisitions.

Dave Sokol, MEHC’s CEO, and Greg Abel, his key associate, are huge assets for Berkshire. They
are dealmakers, and they are managers. Berkshire stands ready to inject massive amounts of money into
MEHC -— and it will be fun to watch how far Dave and Greg can take the business.
The Economics of Property/Casualty Insurance

Our core business — though we have others of great importance — is insurance. To understand
Berkshire, therefore, it is necessary that you understand how to evaluate an insurance company. The key
determinants are: (1) the amount of float that the business generates; (2) its cost; and (3) most critical of all,
the long-term outlook for both of these factors.

To begin with, float is money we hold but don't own. In an insurance operation, float arises
because premiums are received before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes extends over many years.
During that time, the insurer invests the money. This pleasant activity typically carries with it a downside:
The premiums that an insurer takes in usually do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay.
That leaves it running an “underwriting loss,” which is the cost of float. An insurance business has value if
its cost of float over time is less than the cost the company would otherwise incur to obtain funds. But the
business is a lemon if its cost of float is higher than market rates for money. Moreover, the downward
trend of interest rates in recent years has transformed underwriting losses that formerly were tolerable into
burdens that move insurance businesses deeply into the lemon category.

Historically, Berkshire has obtained its float at a very low cost. Indeed, our cost has been less than
zero in many years; that is, we’ve actually been paid for holding other people’s money. In 2001, however,
our cost was terrible, coming in at 12.8%, about half of which was attributable to World Trade Center
losses. Back in 1983-84, we had years that were even worse. There’s nothing automatic about cheap float.

The table that follows shows (at intervals) the float generated by the various segments of
Berkshire’s insurance operations since we entered the business 36 years ago upon acquiring National
Indemnity Company (whose traditional lines are included in the segment “Other Primary”). For the table
we have calculated our float — which we generate in large amounts relative to our premium volume — by
adding net loss reserves, loss adjustment reserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned
premium reserves, and then subtracting insurance-related receivables, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid
taxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance. (Got that?)

Last year our cost of float was 1%. As I mentioned earlier, you should temper your enthusiasm
about this favorable result given that no megacatastrophe occurred in 2002. We’re certain to get one of
these disasters periodically, and when we do our float-cost will spike.
Our 2002 results were hurt by 1) a painful charge at General Re for losses that should have been
recorded as costs in earlier years, and 2) a “desirable” charge we incur annually for retroactive insurance (see
the next section for more about these items). These costs totaled $1.75 billion, or about 4.6% of float.
Fortunately, our overall underwriting experience on 2002 business was excellent, which allowed us, even
after the charges noted, to approach a no-cost result.

Absent a megacatastrophe, I expect our cost of float in 2003 to again be very low — perhaps even less
than zero. In the rundown of our insurance operations that follows, you will see why I’m optimistic that, over
time, our underwriting results will both surpass those achieved by the industry and deliver us investable funds
at minimal cost.

Insurance Operations

If our insurance operations are to generate low-cost float over time, they must: (a) underwrite with
unwavering discipline; (b) reserve conservatively; and (c) avoid an aggregation of exposures that would allow
a supposedly “impossible” incident to threaten their solvency. All of our major insurance businesses, with
one exception, have regularly met those tests.

The exception is General Re, and there was much to do at that company last year to get it up to
snuff. I’m delighted to report that under Joe Brandon’s leadership, and with yeoman assistance by Tad
Montross, enormous progress has been made on each of the fronts described.

When I agreed in 1998 to merge Berkshire with Gen Re, I thought that company stuck to the three
rules I’ve enumerated. I had studied the operation for decades and had observed underwriting discipline that
was consistent and reserving that was conservative. At merger time, I detected no slippage in Gen Re’s
standards.

I was dead wrong. Gen Re’s culture and practices had substantially changed and unbeknownst to
management — and to me — the company was grossly mispricing its current business. In addition, Gen Re had
accumulated an aggregation of risks that would have been fatal had, say, terrorists detonated several large-
scale nuclear bombs in an attack on the U.S. A disaster of that scope was highly improbable, of course, but it
is up to insurers to limit their risks in a manner that leaves their finances rock-solid if the “impossible”
happens. Indeed, had Gen Re remained independent, the World Trade Center attack alone would have
threatened the company’s existence.

When the WTC disaster occurred, it exposed weaknesses in Gen Re’s operations that I should have
detected earlier. But I was lucky: Joe and Tad were on hand, freshly endowed with increased authority and
eager to rapidly correct the errors of the past. They knew what to do — and they did it.

It takes time for insurance policies to run off, however, and 2002 was well along before we managed
to reduce our aggregation of nuclear, chemical and biological risk (NCB) to a tolerable level. That problem is
now behind us.

On another front, Gen Re’s underwriting attitude has been dramatically altered: The entire
organization now understands that we wish to write only properly-priced business, whatever the effect on
volume. Joe and Tad judge themselves only by Gen Re’s underwriting profitability. Size simply doesn’t
count.

Finally, we are making every effort to get our reserving right. If we fail at that, we can’t know our
true costs. And any insurer that has no idea what its costs are is heading for big trouble.
At yearend 2001, General Re attempted to reserve adequately for all losses that had occurred prior to
that date and were not yet paid — but we failed badly. Therefore the company’s 2002 underwriting results
were penalized by an additional $1.31 billion that we recorded to correct the estimation mistakes of earlier
years. When I review the reserving errors that have been uncovered at General Re, a line from a country song
seems apt: “I wish I didn’t know now what I didn’t know then.”

I can promise you that our top priority going forward is to avoid inadequate reserving. But I can’t
guarantee success. The natural tendency of most casualty-insurance managers is to underreserve, and they
must have a particular mindset — which, it may surprise you, has nothing to do with actuarial expertise — if
they are to overcome this devastating bias. Additionally, a reinsurer faces far more difficulties in reserving
properly than does a primary insurer. Nevertheless, at Berkshire, we have generally been successful in our
reserving, and we are determined to be at General Re as well.

In summary, I believe General Re is now well positioned to deliver huge amounts of no-cost float to
Berkshire and that its sink-the-ship catastrophe risk has been eliminated. The company still possesses the
important competitive strengths that I’ve outlined in the past. And it gained another highly significant
advantage last year when each of its three largest worldwide competitors, previously rated AAA, was
demoted by at least one rating agency. Among the giants, General Re, rated AAA across-the-board, is now in
a class by itself in respect to financial strength.

No attribute is more important. Recently, in contrast, one of the world’s largest reinsurers — a
company regularly recommended to primary insurers by leading brokers — has all but ceased paying claims,
including those both valid and due. This company owes many billions of dollars to hundreds of primary
insurers who now face massive write-offs. “Cheap” reinsurance is a fool’s bargain: When an insurer lays out
money today in exchange for a reinsurer’s promise to pay a decade or two later, it’s dangerous — and possibly
life-threatening — for the insurer to deal with any but the strongest reinsurer around.

Berkshire shareholders owe Joe and Tad a huge thank you for their accomplishments in 2002. They
worked harder during the year than I would wish for anyone — and it is paying off.

At GEICO, everything went so well in 2002 that we should pinch ourselves. Growth was
substantial, profits were outstanding, policyholder retention was up and sales productivity jumped
significantly. These trends continue in early 2003.

Thank Tony Nicely for all of this. As anyone who knows him will attest, Tony has been in love with
GEICO for 41 years — ever since he went to work for the company at 18 — and his results reflect this passion.
He is proud of the money we save policyholders — about $1 billion annually versus what other insurers, on
average, would have charged them. He is proud of the service we provide these policyholders: In a key
industry survey, GEICO was recently ranked above all major competitors. He is proud of his 19,162
associates, who last year were awarded profit-sharing payments equal to 19% of their base salary because of
the splendid results they achieved. And he is proud of the growing profits he delivers to Berkshire
shareholders.

GEICO took in $2.9 billion in premiums when Berkshire acquired full ownership in 1996. Last
year, its volume was $6.9 billion, with plenty of growth to come. Particularly promising is the company’s
Internet operation, whose new business grew by 75% last year. Check us out at GEICO.com (or call 800-
847-7536). In most states, shareholders get a special 8% discount.

Here’s one footnote to GEICO’s 2002 earnings that underscores the need for insurers to do business
with only the strongest of reinsurers. In 1981-1983, the managers then running GEICO decided to try their
hand at writing commercial umbrella and product liability insurance. The risks seemed modest: the company
took in only $3,051,000 from this line and used almost all of it — $2,979,000 — to buy reinsurance in order to
limit its losses. GEICO was left with a paltry $72,000 as compensation for the minor portion of the risk that
it retained. But this small bite of the apple was more than enough to make the experience memorable.
GEICO’s losses from this venture now total a breathtaking $94.1 million or about 130,000% of the net
premium it received. Of the total loss, uncollectable receivables from deadbeat reinsurers account for no less
than $90.3 million (including $19 million charged in 2002). So much for “cheap” reinsurance.

Ajit Jain’s reinsurance division was the major reason our float cost us so little last year. If we ever
put a photo in a Berkshire annual report, it will be of Ajit. In color!

Ajit’s operation has amassed $13.4 billion of float, more than all but a handful of insurers have ever
built up. He accomplished this from a standing start in 1986, and even now has a workforce numbering only
20. And, most important, he has produced underwriting profits.

His profits are particularly remarkable if you factor in some accounting arcana that I am about to lay
on you. So prepare to eat your spinach (or, alternatively, if debits and credits aren’t your thing, skip the next
two paragraphs).

Ajit’s 2002 underwriting profit of $534 million came affer his operation recognized a charge of $428
million attributable to “retroactive” insurance he has written over the years. In this line of business, we
assume from another insurer the obligation to pay up to a specified amount for losses they have already
incurred — often for events that took place decades earlier — but that are yet to be paid (for example, because a
worker hurt in 1980 will recetve monthly payments for life). In these arrangements, an insurer pays us a large
upfront premium, but one that is less than the losses we expect to pay. We willingly accept this differential
because a) our payments are capped, and b) we get to use the money until loss payments are actually made,
with these often stretching out over a decade or more. About 80% of the $6.6 billion in asbestos and
environmental loss reserves that we carry arises from capped contracts, whose costs consequently can’t

skyrocket.

When we write a retroactive policy, we immediately record both the premium and a reserve for the
expected losses. The difference between the two is entered as an asset entitled “deferred charges —
reinsurance assumed.” This is no small item: at yearend, for all retroactive policies, it was $3.4 billion. We
then amortize this asset downward by charges to income over the expected life of each policy. These charges
— $440 million in 2002, including charges at Gen Re — create an underwriting loss, but one that is intentional
and desirable. And even after this drag on reported results, Ajit achieved a large underwriting gain last year.

We want to emphasize, however, that we assume risks in Ajit’s operation that are huge — far larger
than those retained by any other insurer in the world. Therefore, a single event could cause a major swing in
Ajit’s results in any given quarter or year. That bothers us not at all: As long as we are paid appropriately, we
love taking on short-term volatility that others wish to shed. At Berkshire, we would rather earn a lumpy
15% over time than a smooth 12%.

If you see Ajit at our annual meeting, bow deeply.

Berkshire’s smaller insurers had an outstanding year. Their aggregate float grew by 38%, and they
realized an underwriting profit of $32 million, or 4.5% of premiums. Collectively, these operations would
make one of the finest insurance companies in the country.

Included in these figures, however, were terrible results in our California workers’ compensation
operation. There, we have work to do. There, too, our reserving severely missed the mark. Until we figure
out how to get this business right, we will keep it small.

For the fabulous year they had in 2002, we thank Rod Eldred, John Kizer, Tom Nerney, Don Towle
and Don Wurster. They added a lot of value to your Berkshire investment.

Sources of Reported Earnings

The table that follows shows the main sources of Berkshire’s reported earnings. You will notice that
“Purchase-Accounting Adjustments” dropped sharply in 2002, the reason being that GAAP rules changed
then, no longer requiring the amortization of goodwill. This change increases our reported earnings, but has
no effect on our economic earnings.

°) From date of acquisition, January 8, 2001.

Here’s a summary of major developments at our non-insurance businesses:

MidAmerican Energy’s earnings grew in 2002 and will likely do so again this year. Most of the
increase, both present and expected, results from the acquisitions described earlier. To fund these,
Berkshire purchased $1,273 million of MidAmerican junior debt (bringing our total holdings of
these 11% obligations to $1,728 million) and also invested $402 million in a “common-equivalent”
stock. We now own (on a fully-diluted basis) 80.2% of MidAmerican’s equity. MidAmerican’s
financial statements are presented in detail on page 37.

Last year I told you of the problems at Dexter that led to a huge loss in our shoe business. Thanks to
Frank Rooney and Jim Issler of HH. Brown, the Dexter operation has been turned around. Despite

the cost of unwinding our problems there, we earned $24 million in shoes last year, an upward swing
of $70 million from 2001.

Randy Watson at Justin also contributed to this improvement, increasing margins significantly while
trimming invested capital. Shoes are a tough business, but we have terrific managers and believe
that in the future we will earn reasonable returns on the capital we employ in this operation.

11
In a so-so year for home-furnishing and jewelry retailers, our operations did well. Among our eight
retailing operations, the best performer was Homemaker’s in Des Moines. There, the talented
Merschman family achieved outstanding gains in both sales and profits.

Nebraska Furniture Mart will open a new blockbuster store in metropolitan Kansas City in August.
With 450,000 square feet of retail space, it could well produce the second largest volume of any
furniture store in the country — the Omaha operation being the national champion. I hope Berkshire
shareholders in the Kansas City area will come out for the opening (and keep coming).

Our home and construction-related businesses — Acme Brick, Benjamin Moore Paint, Johns-
Manville, MiTek and Shaw — delivered $941 million of pre-tax earnings last year. Of particular
significance was Shaw’s gain from $292 million in 2001 to $424 million. Bob Shaw and Julian Saul
are terrific operators. Carpet prices increased only 1% last year, but Shaw’s productivity gains and
excellent expense control delivered significantly improved margins.

We cherish cost-consciousness at Berkshire. Our model is the widow who went to the local
newspaper to place an obituary notice. Told there was a 25-cents-a-word charge, she requested
“Fred Brown died.” She was then informed there was a seven-word minimum. “Okay” the

299

bereaved woman replied, “make it ‘Fred Brown died, golf clubs for sale’.

Earnings from flight services increased last year — but only because we realized a special pre-tax
gain of $60 million from the sale of our 50% interest in FlightSafety Boeing. Without this gain,
earnings from our training business would have fallen slightly in concert with the slowdown in
business-aviation activity. FlightSafety training continues to be the gold standard for the industry,
and we expect growth in the years to come.

At NetJets, our fractional-ownership operation, we are the runaway leader of the four-company field.
FAA records indicate that our industry share in 2002 was 75%, meaning that clients purchased or
leased planes from us that were valued at triple those recorded by our three competitors combined.
Last year, our fleet flew 132.7 million nautical miles, taking clients to 130 countries.

Our preeminence is directly attributable to Rich Santulli, NetJets’ CEO. He invented the business in
1986 and ever since has exhibited an unbending devotion to the highest levels of service, safety and
security. Rich, Charlie and I insist on planes (and personnel) worthy of carrying our own families —
because they regularly do.

Though NetJets revenues set a record in 2002, the company again lost money. A small profit in the
U.S. was more than offset by losses in Europe. Overall, the fractional-ownership industry lost
significant sums last year, and that is almost certain to be the outcome in 2003 as well. The bald fact
is that airplanes are costly to operate.

Over time, this economic reality should work to our advantage, given that for a great many
companies, private aircraft are an essential business tool. And for most of these companies, NetJets
makes compelling sense as either a primary or supplementary supplier of the aircraft they need.

Many businesses could save millions of dollars annually by flying with us. Indeed, the yearly
savings at some large companies could exceed $10 million. Equally important, these companies
would actually increase their operational capabilities by using us. A fractional ownership of a single
NetJets plane allows a client to have several planes in the air simultaneously. Additionally, through
the interchange arrangement we make available, an owner of an interest in one plane can fly any of
12 other models, using whatever plane makes most sense for a mission. (One of my sisters owns a
fraction of a Falcon 2000, which she uses for trips to Hawaii, but — exhibiting the Buffett gene — she
interchanges to a more economical Citation Excel for short trips in the U.S.)

The roster of NetJets users confirms the advantages we offer major businesses. Take General
Electric, for example. It has a large fleet of its own but also has an unsurpassed knowledge of how
to utilize aircraft effectively and economically. And it is our largest customer.

Our finance and financial products line covers a variety of operations, among them certain activities
in high-grade fixed-income securities that proved highly profitable in 2002. Earnings in this arena
will probably continue for a while, but are certain to decrease — and perhaps disappear — in time.

12
This category also includes a highly satisfactory — but rapidly diminishing — income stream from our
Berkadia investment in Finova (described in last year’s report). Our partner, Leucadia National
Corp., has managed this operation with great skill, willingly doing far more than its share of the
heavy lifting. I like this division of labor and hope to join with Leucadia in future transactions.

On the minus side, the Finance line also includes the operations of General Re Securities, a
derivatives and trading business. This entity lost $173 million pre-tax last year, a result that, in part,
is a belated acknowledgment of faulty, albeit standard, accounting it used in earlier periods.
Derivatives, in fact, deserve an extensive look, both in respect to the accounting their users employ
and to the problems they may pose for both individual companies and our economy.

Derivatives

Charlie and I are of one mind in how we feel about derivatives and the trading activities that go with
them: We view them as time bombs, both for the parties that deal in them and the economic system.

Having delivered that thought, which I’ll get back to, let me retreat to explaining derivatives, though
the explanation must be general because the word covers an extraordinarily wide range of financial contracts.
Essentially, these instruments call for money to change hands at some future date, with the amount to be
determined by one or more reference items, such as interest rates, stock prices or currency values. If, for
example, you are either long or short an S&P 500 futures contract, you are a party to a very simple derivatives
transaction — with your gain or loss derived from movements in the index. Derivatives contracts are of
varying duration (running sometimes to 20 or more years) and their value is often tied to several variables.

Unless derivatives contracts are collateralized or guaranteed, their ultimate value also depends on the
creditworthiness of the counterparties to them. In the meantime, though, before a contract is settled, the
counterparties record profits and losses — often huge in amount — in their current earnings statements without
so much as a penny changing hands.

The range of derivatives contracts is limited only by the imagination of man (or sometimes, so it
seems, madmen). At Enron, for example, newsprint and broadband derivatives, due to be settled many years
in the future, were put on the books. Or say you want to write a contract speculating on the number of twins
to be born in Nebraska in 2020. No problem — at a price, you will easily find an obliging counterparty.

When we purchased Gen Re, it came with General Re Securities, a derivatives dealer that Charlie
and I didn’t want, judging it to be dangerous. We failed in our attempts to sell the operation, however, and
are now terminating it.

But closing down a derivatives business is easier said than done. It will be a great many years before
we are totally out of this operation (though we reduce our exposure daily). In fact, the reinsurance and
derivatives businesses are similar: Like Hell, both are easy to enter and almost impossible to exit. In either
industry, once you write a contract — which may require a large payment decades later — you are usually stuck
with it. True, there are methods by which the risk can be laid off with others. But most strategies of that kind
leave you with residual liability.

Another commonality of reinsurance and derivatives is that both generate reported earnings that are
often wildly overstated. That’s true because today’s earnings are in a significant way based on estimates
whose inaccuracy may not be exposed for many years.

Errors will usually be honest, reflecting only the human tendency to take an optimistic view of one’s
commitments. But the parties to derivatives also have enormous incentives to cheat in accounting for them.
Those who trade derivatives are usually paid (in whole or part) on “earnings” calculated by mark-to-market
accounting. But often there is no real market (think about our contract involving twins) and “mark-to-model”
is utilized. This substitution can bring on large-scale mischief. As a general rule, contracts involving
multiple reference items and distant settlement dates increase the opportunities for counterparties to use
fanciful assumptions. In the twins scenario, for example, the two parties to the contract might well use
differing models allowing both to show substantial profits for many years. In extreme cases, mark-to-model
degenerates into what I would call mark-to-myth.

Of course, both internal and outside auditors review the numbers, but that’s no easy job. For
example, General Re Securities at yearend (after ten months of winding down its operation) had 14,384

13
contracts outstanding, involving 672 counterparties around the world. Each contract had a plus or minus
value derived from one or more reference items, including some of mind-boggling complexity. Valuing a
portfolio like that, expert auditors could easily and honestly have widely varying opinions.

The valuation problem is far from academic: In recent years, some huge-scale frauds and near-frauds
have been facilitated by derivatives trades. In the energy and electric utility sectors, for example, companies
used derivatives and trading activities to report great “earnings” — until the roof fell in when they actually
tried to convert the derivatives-related receivables on their balance sheets into cash. “Mark-to-market” then
turned out to be truly “mark-to-myth.”

I can assure you that the marking errors in the derivatives business have not been symmetrical.
Almost invariably, they have favored either the trader who was eyeing a multi-million dollar bonus or the
CEO who wanted to report impressive “earnings” (or both). The bonuses were paid, and the CEO profited
from his options. Only much later did shareholders learn that the reported earnings were a sham.

Another problem about derivatives is that they can exacerbate trouble that a corporation has run into
for completely unrelated reasons. This pile-on effect occurs because many derivatives contracts require that a
company suffering a credit downgrade immediately supply collateral to counterparties. Imagine, then, that a
company is downgraded because of general adversity and that its derivatives instantly kick in with their
requirement, imposing an unexpected and enormous demand for cash collateral on the company. The need to
meet this demand can then throw the company into a liquidity crisis that may, in some cases, trigger still more
downgrades. It all becomes a spiral that can lead to a corporate meltdown.

Derivatives also create a daisy-chain risk that is akin to the risk run by insurers or reinsurers that lay
off much of their business with others. In both cases, huge receivables from many counterparties tend to
build up over time. (At Gen Re Securities, we still have $6.5 billion of receivables, though we’ve been in a
liquidation mode for nearly a year.) A participant may see himself as prudent, believing his large credit
exposures to be diversified and therefore not dangerous. Under certain circumstances, though, an exogenous
event that causes the receivable from Company A to go bad will also affect those from Companies B through
Z. History teaches us that a crisis often causes problems to correlate in a manner undreamed of in more
tranquil times.

In banking, the recognition of a “linkage” problem was one of the reasons for the formation of the
Federal Reserve System. Before the Fed was established, the failure of weak banks would sometimes put
sudden and unanticipated liquidity demands on previously-strong banks, causing them to fail in turn. The
Fed now insulates the strong from the troubles of the weak. But there is no central bank assigned to the job of
preventing the dominoes toppling in insurance or derivatives. In these industries, firms that are
fundamentally solid can become troubled simply because of the travails of other firms further down the chain.
When a “chain reaction” threat exists within an industry, it pays to minimize links of any kind. That’s how
we conduct our reinsurance business, and it’s one reason we are exiting derivatives.

Many people argue that derivatives reduce systemic problems, in that participants who can’t bear
certain risks are able to transfer them to stronger hands. These people believe that derivatives act to stabilize
the economy, facilitate trade, and eliminate bumps for individual participants. And, on a micro level, what
they say is often true. Indeed, at Berkshire, I sometimes engage in large-scale derivatives transactions in
order to facilitate certain investment strategies.

Charlie and I believe, however, that the macro picture is dangerous and getting more so. Large
amounts of risk, particularly credit risk, have become concentrated in the hands of relatively few derivatives
dealers, who in addition trade extensively with one other. The troubles of one could quickly infect the others.
On top of that, these dealers are owed huge amounts by non-dealer counterparties. Some of these
counterparties, as I’ve mentioned, are linked in ways that could cause them to contemporaneously run into a
problem because of a single event (such as the implosion of the telecom industry or the precipitous decline in
the value of merchant power projects). Linkage, when it suddenly surfaces, can trigger serious systemic
problems.

Indeed, in 1998, the leveraged and derivatives-heavy activities of a single hedge fund, Long-Term
Capital Management, caused the Federal Reserve anxieties so severe that it hastily orchestrated a rescue
effort. In later Congressional testimony, Fed officials acknowledged that, had they not intervened, the
outstanding trades of LTCM — a firm unknown to the general public and employing only a few hundred

14
people — could well have posed a serious threat to the stability of American markets. In other words, the Fed
acted because its leaders were fearful of what might have happened to other financial institutions had the
LTCM domino toppled. And this affair, though it paralyzed many parts of the fixed-income market for
weeks, was far from a worst-case scenario.

One of the derivatives instruments that LTCM used was total-return swaps, contracts that facilitate
100% leverage in various markets, including stocks. For example, Party A to a contract, usually a bank, puts
up all of the money for the purchase of a stock while Party B, without putting up any capital, agrees that at a
future date it will receive any gain or pay any loss that the bank realizes.

Total-return swaps of this type make a joke of margin requirements. Beyond that, other types of
derivatives severely curtail the ability of regulators to curb leverage and generally get their arms around the
risk profiles of banks, insurers and other financial institutions. Similarly, even experienced investors and
analysts encounter major problems in analyzing the financial condition of firms that are heavily involved with
derivatives contracts. When Charlie and I finish reading the long footnotes detailing the derivatives activities
of major banks, the only thing we understand is that we don’t understand how much risk the institution is
running.

The derivatives genie is now well out of the bottle, and these instruments will almost certainly
multiply in variety and number until some event makes their toxicity clear. Knowledge of how dangerous
they are has already permeated the electricity and gas businesses, in which the eruption of major troubles
caused the use of derivatives to diminish dramatically. Elsewhere, however, the derivatives business
continues to expand unchecked. Central banks and governments have so far found no effective way to
control, or even monitor, the risks posed by these contracts.

Charlie and I believe Berkshire should be a fortress of financial strength — for the sake of our
owners, creditors, policyholders and employees. We try to be alert to any sort of megacatastrophe risk, and
that posture may make us unduly apprehensive about the burgeoning quantities of long-term derivatives
contracts and the massive amount of uncollateralized receivables that are growing alongside. In our view,
however, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are
potentially lethal.

We continue to do little in equities. Charlie and I are increasingly comfortable with our holdings in
Berkshire’s major investees because most of them have increased their earnings while their valuations have
decreased. But we are not inclined to add to them. Though these enterprises have good prospects, we don’t
yet believe their shares are undervalued.

In our view, the same conclusion fits stocks generally. Despite three years of falling prices, which
have significantly improved the attractiveness of common stocks, we still find very few that even mildly

15
interest us. That dismal fact is testimony to the insanity of valuations reached during The Great Bubble.
Unfortunately, the hangover may prove to be proportional to the binge.

The aversion to equities that Charlie and I exhibit today is far from congenital. We love owning
common stocks — if they can be purchased at attractive prices. In my 61 years of investing, 50 or so years
have offered that kind of opportunity. There will be years like that again. Unless, however, we see a very
high probability of at least 10% pre-tax returns (which translate to 6'4-7% after corporate tax), we will sit on
the sidelines. With short-term money returning less than 1% after-tax, sitting it out is no fun. But
occasionally successful investing requires inactivity.

Last year we were, however, able to make sensible investments in a few “junk” bonds and loans.
Overall, our commitments in this sector sextupled, reaching $8.3 billion by yearend.

Investing in junk bonds and investing in stocks are alike in certain ways: Both activities require us to
make a price-value calculation and also to scan hundreds of securities to find the very few that have attractive
reward/risk ratios. But there are important differences between the two disciplines as well. In stocks, we
expect every commitment to work out well because we concentrate on conservatively financed businesses
with strong competitive strengths, run by able and honest people. If we buy into these companies at sensible
prices, losses should be rare. Indeed, during the 38 years we have run the company’s affairs, gains from the
equities we manage at Berkshire (that is, excluding those managed at General Re and GEICO) have exceeded
losses by a ratio of about 100 to one.

Purchasing junk bonds, we are dealing with enterprises that are far more marginal. These businesses
are usually overloaded with debt and often operate in industries characterized by low returns on capital.
Additionally, the quality of management is sometimes questionable. Management may even have interests
that are directly counter to those of debtholders. Therefore, we expect that we will have occasional large
losses in junk issues. So far, however, we have done reasonably well in this field.

Corporate Governance

Both the ability and fidelity of managers have long needed monitoring. Indeed, nearly 2,000 years
ago, Jesus Christ addressed this subject, speaking (Luke 16:2) approvingly of “a certain rich man” who told
his manager, “Give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest no longer be steward.”

Accountability and stewardship withered in the last decade, becoming qualities deemed of little
importance by those caught up in the Great Bubble. As stock prices went up, the behavioral norms of
managers went down. By the late ’90s, as a result, CEOs who traveled the high road did not encounter heavy
traffic.

Most CEOs, it should be noted, are men and women you would be happy to have as trustees for your
children’s assets or as next-door neighbors. Too many of these people, however, have in recent years
behaved badly at the office, fudging numbers and drawing obscene pay for mediocre business achievements.
These otherwise decent people simply followed the career path of Mae West: “I was Snow White but I
drifted.”

In theory, corporate boards should have prevented this deterioration of conduct. I last wrote about
the responsibilities of directors in the 1993 annual report. (We will send you a copy of this discussion on
request, or you may read it on the Internet in the Corporate Governance section of the 1993 letter.) There, I
said that directors “should behave as if there was a single absentee owner, whose long-term interest they
should try to further in all proper ways.” This means that directors must get rid of a manager who is mediocre
or worse, no matter how likable he may be. Directors must react as did the chorus-girl bride of an 85-year-
old multimillionaire when he asked whether she would love him if he lost his money. “Of course,” the young
beauty replied, “I would miss you, but I would still love you.”

In the 1993 annual report, I also said directors had another job: “If able but greedy managers over-
reach and try to dip too deeply into the shareholders’ pockets, directors must slap their hands.” Since I wrote
that, over-reaching has become common but few hands have been slapped.

Why have intelligent and decent directors failed so miserably? The answer lies not in inadequate
laws — it’s always been clear that directors are obligated to represent the interests of shareholders — but rather
in what I’d call “boardroom atmosphere.”

16
It’s almost impossible, for example, in a boardroom populated by well-mannered people, to raise the
question of whether the CEO should be replaced. It’s equally awkward to question a proposed acquisition
that has been endorsed by the CEO, particularly when his inside staff and outside advisors are present and
unanimously support his decision. (They wouldn’t be in the room if they didn’t.) Finally, when the
compensation committee — armed, as always, with support from a high-paid consultant — reports on a
megagrant of options to the CEO, it would be like belching at the dinner table for a director to suggest that the
committee reconsider.

These “social” difficulties argue for outside directors regularly meeting without the CEO — a reform
that is being instituted and that I enthusiastically endorse. I doubt, however, that most of the other new
governance rules and recommendations will provide benefits commensurate with the monetary and other
costs they impose.

The current cry is for “independent” directors. It is certainly true that it is desirable to have directors
who think and speak independently — but they must also be business-savvy, interested and shareholder-
oriented. In my 1993 commentary, those are the three qualities I described as essential.

Over a span of 40 years, I have been on 19 public-company boards (excluding Berkshire’s) and have
interacted with perhaps 250 directors. Most of them were “independent” as defined by today’s rules. But the
great majority of these directors lacked at least one of the three qualities I value. As a result, their
contribution to shareholder well-being was minimal at best and, too often, negative. These people, decent and
intelligent though they were, simply did not know enough about business and/or care enough about
shareholders to question foolish acquisitions or egregious compensation. My own behavior, I must ruefully
add, frequently fell short as well: Too often I was silent when management made proposals that I judged to be
counter to the interests of shareholders. In those cases, collegiality trumped independence.

So that we may further see the failings of “independence,” let’s look at a 62-year case study covering
thousands of companies. Since 1940, federal law has mandated that a large proportion of the directors of
investment companies (most of these mutual funds) be independent. The requirement was originally 40% and
now it is 50%. In any case, the typical fund has long operated with a majority of directors who qualify as
independent.

These directors and the entire board have many perfunctory duties, but in actuality have only two
important responsibilities: obtaining the best possible investment manager and negotiating with that manager
for the lowest possible fee. When you are seeking investment help yourself, those two goals are the only ones
that count, and directors acting for other investors should have exactly the same priorities. Yet when it comes
to independent directors pursuing either goal, their record has been absolutely pathetic.

Many thousands of investment-company boards meet annually to carry out the vital job of selecting
who will manage the savings of the millions of owners they represent. Year after year the directors of Fund
A select manager A, Fund B directors select manager B, etc. ... in a zombie-like process that makes a
mockery of stewardship. Very occasionally, a board will revolt. But for the most part, a monkey will type
out a Shakespeare play before an “independent” mutual-fund director will suggest that his fund look at other
managers, even if the incumbent manager has persistently delivered substandard performance. When they are
handling their own money, of course, directors will look to alternative advisors — but it never enters their
minds to do so when they are acting as fiduciaries for others.

The hypocrisy permeating the system is vividly exposed when a fund management company — call it
“A” — is sold for a huge sum to Manager “B”. Now the “independent” directors experience a “counter-
revelation” and decide that Manager B is the best that can be found — even though B was available (and
ignored) in previous years. Not so incidentally, B also could formerly have been hired at a far lower rate than
is possible now that it has bought Manager A. That’s because B has laid out a fortune to acquire A, and B
must now recoup that cost through fees paid by the A shareholders who were “delivered” as part of the deal.
(For a terrific discussion of the mutual fund business, read John Bogle’s Common Sense on Mutual Funds.)

A few years ago, my daughter was asked to become a director of a family of funds managed by a
major institution. The fees she would have received as a director were very substantial, enough to have
increased her annual income by about 50% (a boost, she will tell you, she could use!). Legally, she would
have been an independent director. But did the fund manager who approached her think there was any
chance that she would think independently as to what advisor the fund should employ? Of course not. I am

17
proud to say that she showed real independence by turning down the offer. The fund, however, had no
trouble filling the slot (and — surprise — the fund has not changed managers).

Investment company directors have failed as well in negotiating management fees (just as
compensation committees of many American companies have failed to hold the compensation of their CEOs
to sensible levels). If you or I were empowered, I can assure you that we could easily negotiate materially
lower management fees with the incumbent managers of most mutual funds. And, believe me, if directors
were promised a portion of any fee savings they realized, the skies would be filled with falling fees. Under
the current system, though, reductions mean nothing to “independent” directors while meaning everything to
managers. So guess who wins?

Having the right money manager, of course, is far more important to a fund than reducing the
manager’s fee. Both tasks are nonetheless the job of directors. And in stepping up to these all-important
responsibilities, tens of thousands of “independent” directors, over more than six decades, have failed
miserably. (They’ve succeeded, however, in taking care of themselves; their fees from serving on multiple
boards of a single “family” of funds often run well into six figures. )

When the manager cares deeply and the directors don’t, what’s needed is a powerful countervailing
force — and that’s the missing element in today’s corporate governance. Getting rid of mediocre CEOs and
eliminating overreaching by the able ones requires action by owners — big owners. The logistics aren’t that
tough: The ownership of stock has grown increasingly concentrated in recent decades, and today it would be
easy for institutional managers to exert their will on problem situations. Twenty, or even fewer, of the largest
institutions, acting together, could effectively reform corporate governance at a given company, simply by
withholding their votes for directors who were tolerating odious behavior. In my view, this kind of concerted
action is the only way that corporate stewardship can be meaningfully improved.

Unfortunately, certain major investing institutions have “glass house” problems in arguing for better
governance elsewhere; they would shudder, for example, at the thought of their own performance and fees
being closely inspected by their own boards. But Jack Bogle of Vanguard fame, Chris Davis of Davis
Advisors, and Bill Miller of Legg Mason are now offering leadership in getting CEOs to treat their owners
properly. Pension funds, as well as other fiduciaries, will reap better investment returns in the future if they
support these men.

The acid test for reform will be CEO compensation. Managers will cheerfully agree to board
“diversity,” attest to SEC filings and adopt meaningless proposals relating to process. What many will fight,
however, is a hard look at their own pay and perks.

In recent years compensation committees too often have been tail-wagging puppy dogs meekly
following recommendations by consultants, a breed not known for allegiance to the faceless shareholders who
pay their fees. (If you can’t tell whose side someone is on, they are nof on yours.) True, each committee is
required by the SEC to state its reasoning about pay in the proxy. But the words are usually boilerplate
written by the company’s lawyers or its human-relations department.

This costly charade should cease. Directors should not serve on compensation committees unless
they are themselves capable of negotiating on behalf of owners. They should explain both how they think
about pay and how they measure performance. Dealing with shareholders’ money, moreover, they should
behave as they would were it their own.

In the 1890s, Samuel Gompers described the goal of organized labor as “More!” In the 1990s,
America’s CEOs adopted his battle cry. The upshot is that CEOs have often amassed riches while their
shareholders have experienced financial disasters.

Directors should stop such piracy. There’s nothing wrong with paying well for truly exceptional
business performance. But, for anything short of that, it’s time for directors to shout “Less!” It would be a
travesty if the bloated pay of recent years became a baseline for future compensation. Compensation
committees should go back to the drawing boards.

Rules that have been proposed and that are almost certain to go into effect will require changes in
Berkshire’s board, obliging us to add directors who meet the codified requirements for “independence.”

18
Doing so, we will add a test that we believe is important, but far from determinative, in fostering
independence: We will select directors who have huge and true ownership interests (that is, stock that they or
their family have purchased, not been given by Berkshire or received via options), expecting those interests to
influence their actions to a degree that dwarfs other considerations such as prestige and board fees.

That gets to an often-overlooked point about directors’ compensation, which at public companies
averages perhaps $50,000 annually. It baffles me how the many directors who look to these dollars for
perhaps 20% or more of their annual income can be considered independent when Ron Olson, for example,
who is on our board, may be deemed not independent because he receives a tiny percentage of his very large
income from Berkshire legal fees. As the investment company saga suggests, a director whose moderate
income is heavily dependent on directors’ fees — and who hopes mightily to be invited to join other boards in
order to earn more fees — is highly unlikely to offend a CEO or fellow directors, who in a major way will
determine his reputation in corporate circles. If regulators believe that “significant” money taints
independence (and it certainly can), they have overlooked a massive class of possible offenders.

At Berkshire, wanting our fees to be meaningless to our directors, we pay them only a pittance.
Additionally, not wanting to insulate our directors from any corporate disaster we might have, we don’t
provide them with officers’ and directors’ liability insurance (an unorthodoxy that, not so incidentally, has
saved our shareholders many millions of dollars over the years). Basically, we want the behavior of our
directors to be driven by the effect their decisions will have on their family’s net worth, not by their
compensation. That’s the equation for Charlie and me as managers, and we think it’s the right one for
Berkshire directors as well.

To find new directors, we will look through our shareholders list for people who directly, or in their
family, have had large Berkshire holdings — in the millions of dollars — for a long time. Individuals making
that cut should automatically meet two of our tests, namely that they be interested in Berkshire and
shareholder-oriented. In our third test, we will look for business savvy, a competence that is far from
commonplace.

Finally, we will continue to have members of the Buffett family on the board. They are not there to
run the business after I die, nor will they then receive compensation of any kind. Their purpose is to ensure,
for both our shareholders and managers, that Berkshire’s special culture will be nurtured when I’m succeeded
by other CEOs.

Any change we make in the composition of our board will not alter the way Charlie and I run
Berkshire. We will continue to emphasize substance over form in our work and waste as little time as
possible during board meetings in show-and-tell and perfunctory activities. The most important job of our
board is likely to be the selection of successors to Charlie and me, and that is a matter upon which it will
focus.

The board we have had up to now has overseen a shareholder-oriented business, consistently run in
accord with the economic principles set forth on pages 68-74 (which I urge all new shareholders to read).
Our goal is to obtain new directors who are equally devoted to those principles.

The Audit Committee

Audit committees can’t audit. Only a company’s outside auditor can determine whether the earnings
that a management purports to have made are suspect. Reforms that ignore this reality and that instead focus
on the structure and charter of the audit committee will accomplish little.

As we’ve discussed, far too many managers have fudged their company’s numbers in recent years,
using both accounting and operational techniques that are typically legal but that nevertheless materially
mislead investors. Frequently, auditors knew about these deceptions. Too often, however, they remained
silent. The key job of the audit committee is simply to get the auditors to divulge what they know.

To do this job, the committee must make sure that the auditors worry more about misleading its
members than about offending management. In recent years auditors have not felt that way. They have
instead generally viewed the CEO, rather than the shareholders or directors, as their client. That has been a
natural result of day-to-day working relationships and also of the auditors’ understanding that, no matter what
the book says, the CEO and CFO pay their fees and determine whether they are retained for both auditing and
other work. The rules that have been recently instituted won’t materially change this reality. What will break

19
this cozy relationship is audit committees unequivocally putting auditors on the spot, making them understand
they will become liable for major monetary penalties if they don’t come forth with what they know or
suspect.

In my opinion, audit committees can accomplish this goal by asking four questions of auditors, the
answers to which should be recorded and reported to shareholders. These questions are:

1. If the auditor were solely responsible for preparation of the company’s financial statements,
would they have in any way been prepared differently from the manner selected by
management? This question should cover both material and nonmaterial differences. If the
auditor would have done something differently, both management’s argument and the
auditor’s response should be disclosed. The audit committee should then evaluate the facts.

2. If the auditor were an investor, would he have received — in plain English — the information
essential to his understanding the company’s financial performance during the reporting
period?

3. Is the company following the same internal audit procedure that would be followed if the

auditor himself were CEO? If not, what are the differences and why?

4. Is the auditor aware of any actions — either accounting or operational — that have had the
purpose and effect of moving revenues or expenses from one reporting period to another?

If the audit committee asks these questions, its composition — the focus of most reforms — is of minor
importance. In addition, the procedure will save time and expense. When auditors are put on the spot, they
will do their duty. If they are not put on the spot... well, we have seen the results of that.

The questions we have enumerated should be asked at least a week before an earnings report is
released to the public. That timing will allow differences between the auditors and management to be aired
with the committee and resolved. If the timing is tighter — if an earnings release is imminent when the
auditors and committee interact — the committee will feel pressure to rubberstamp the prepared figures. Haste
is the enemy of accuracy. My thinking, in fact, is that the SEC’s recent shortening of reporting deadlines will
hurt the quality of information that shareholders receive. Charlie and I believe that rule is a mistake and
should be rescinded.

The primary advantage of our four questions is that they will act as a prophylactic. Once the
auditors know that the audit committee will require them to affirmatively endorse, rather than merely
acquiesce to, management’s actions, they will resist misdoings early in the process, well before specious
figures become embedded in the company’s books. Fear of the plaintiff's bar will see to that.

2K 2K ok oe ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok

The Chicago Tribune ran a four-part series on Arthur Andersen last September that did a great job of
illuminating how accounting standards and audit quality have eroded in recent years. A few decades ago, an
Arthur Andersen audit opinion was the gold standard of the profession. Within the firm, an elite Professional
Standards Group (PSG) insisted on honest reporting, no matter what pressures were applied by the client.
Sticking to these principles, the PSG took a stand in 1992 that the cost of stock options should be recorded as
the expense it clearly was. The PSG’s position was reversed, however, by the “rainmaking” partners of
Andersen who knew what their clients wanted — higher reported earnings no matter what the reality. Many
CEOs also fought expensing because they knew that the obscene megagrants of options they craved would be
slashed if the true costs of these had to be recorded.

Soon after the Andersen reversal, the independent accounting standards board (FASB) voted 7-0 for
expensing options. Predictably, the major auditing firms and an army of CEOs stormed Washington to
pressure the Senate — what better institution to decide accounting questions? — into castrating the FASB. The
voices of the protesters were amplified by their large political contributions, usually made with corporate
money belonging to the very owners about to be bamboozled. It was not a sight for a civics class.

To its shame, the Senate voted 88-9 against expensing. Several prominent Senators even called for
the demise of the FASB if it didn’t abandon its position. (So much for independence.) Arthur Levitt, Jr., then
Chairman of the SEC — and generally a vigilant champion of shareholders — has since described his reluctant

20
bowing to Congressional and corporate pressures as the act of his chairmanship that he most regrets. (The
details of this sordid affair are related in Levitt’s excellent book, Take on the Street.)

With the Senate in its pocket and the SEC outgunned, corporate America knew that it was now boss
when it came to accounting. With that, a new era of anything-goes earnings reports — blessed and, in some
cases, encouraged by big-name auditors — was launched. The licentious behavior that followed quickly
became an air pump for The Great Bubble.

After being threatened by the Senate, FASB backed off its original position and adopted an “honor
system” approach, declaring expensing to be preferable but also allowing companies to ignore the cost if they
wished. The disheartening result: Of the 500 companies in the S&P, 498 adopted the method deemed less
desirable, which of course let them report higher “earnings.” Compensation-hungry CEOs loved this
outcome: Let FASB have the honor, they had the system.

In our 1992 annual report, discussing the unseemly and self-serving behavior of so many CEOs, I
said “the business elite risks losing its credibility on issues of significance to society — about which it may
have much of value to say — when it advocates the incredible on issues of significance to itself.”

That loss of credibility has occurred. The job of CEOs is now to regain America’s trust — and for the
country’s sake it’s important that they do so. They will not succeed in this endeavor, however, by way of
fatuous ads, meaningless policy statements, or structural changes of boards and committees. Instead, CEOs
must embrace stewardship as a way of life and treat their owners as partners, not patsies. It’s time for CEOs
to walk the walk.

2K 2K ok oe ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok

Three suggestions for investors: First, beware of companies displaying weak accounting. If a
company still does not expense options, or if its pension assumptions are fanciful, watch out. When
managements take the low road in aspects that are visible, it is likely they are following a similar path behind
the scenes. There is seldom just one cockroach in the kitchen.

Trumpeting EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is a particularly
pernicious practice. Doing so implies that depreciation is not truly an expense, given that it is a “non-cash”
charge. That’s nonsense. In truth, depreciation is a particularly unattractive expense because the cash outlay
it represents is paid up front, before the asset acquired has delivered any benefits to the business. Imagine, if
you will, that at the beginning of this year a company paid all of its employees for the next ten years of their
service (in the way they would lay out cash for a fixed asset to be useful for ten years). In the following nine
years, compensation would be a “non-cash” expense — a reduction of a prepaid compensation asset
established this year. Would anyone care to argue that the recording of the expense in years two through ten
would be simply a bookkeeping formality?

Second, unintelligible footnotes usually indicate untrustworthy management. If you can’t
understand a footnote or other managerial explanation, it’s usually because the CEO doesn’t want you to.
Enron’s descriptions of certain transactions sfi/l baffle me.

Finally, be suspicious of companies that trumpet earnings projections and growth expectations.
Businesses seldom operate in a tranquil, no-surprise environment, and earnings simply don’t advance
smoothly (except, of course, in the offering books of investment bankers).

Charlie and I not only don’t know today what our businesses will earn next year — we don’t even
know what they will earn next quarter. We are suspicious of those CEOs who regularly claim they do know
the future — and we become downright incredulous if they consistently reach their declared targets. Managers
that always promise to “make the numbers” will at some point be tempted to make up the numbers.

Shareholder-Designated Contributions

About 97.3% of all eligible shares participated in Berkshire's 2002 shareholder-designated
contributions program, with contributions totaling $16.5 million.

Cumulatively, over the 22 years of the program, Berkshire has made contributions of $197 million
pursuant to the instructions of our shareholders. The rest of Berkshire's giving is done by our subsidiaries,
which stick to the philanthropic patterns that prevailed before they were acquired (except that their former

21
owners themselves take on the responsibility for their personal charities). In aggregate, our subsidiaries made
contributions of $24 million in 2002, including in-kind donations of $4 million.

To participate in future programs, you must own Class A shares that are registered in the name of
the actual owner, not the nominee name of a broker, bank or depository. Shares not so registered on August
31, 2003 will be ineligible for the 2003 program. When you get the contributions form from us, return it
promptly so that it does not get put aside or forgotten. Designations received after the due date will not be
honored.

The Annual Meeting

This year’s annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 3, and once again we will be at the Civic
Auditorium. The doors will open at 7 a.m., the movie will begin at 8:30, and the meeting itself will
commence at 9:30. There will be a short break at noon for food. (Sandwiches will be available at the Civic’s
concession stands.) That interlude aside, Charlie and I will answer questions until 3:30. Give us your best
shot.

An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the
credential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. As for plane, hotel and car
reservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. They do a
terrific job for us each year, and I thank them for it.

In our usual fashion, we will run vans from the larger hotels to the meeting. Afterwards, the vans
will make trips back to the hotels and to Nebraska Furniture Mart, Borsheim’s and the airport. Even so, you
are likely to find a car useful.

Our exhibit area for Berkshire goods and services will be bigger and better than ever this year. So be
prepared to spend. I think you will particularly enjoy visiting The Pampered Chef display, where you may
run into Doris and Sheila.

GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of
them ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a
special shareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 41 of the 49 jurisdictions in
which we operate. Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you
money.

On Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets® available
for your inspection. Just ask a representative at the Civic about viewing any of these planes. If you buy what
we consider an appropriate number of items during the weekend, you may well need your own plane to take
them home. Furthermore, if you buy a fraction of a plane, I’ll personally see that you get a three-pack of
briefs from Fruit of the Loom.

At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72" Street between Dodge and Pacific, we
will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” pricing, which means we will be offering our shareholders a
discount that is customarily given only to employees. We initiated this special pricing at NFM six years ago,
and sales during the “Weekend” grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $14.2 million in 2002.

To get the discount, you must make your purchases during the Thursday, May 1 through Monday,
May 5 period and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even apply to the
products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but that,
in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation.
NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sundays. On Saturday this year,
from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., we are having a special affair for shareholders only. I’ll be there, eating hot dogs and
drinking Coke.

Borsheim’s — the largest jewelry store in the country except for Tiffany’s Manhattan store — will
have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday,
May 2. The second, the main gala, will be from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday, May 4. Ask Charlie to
autograph your sales ticket.

Shareholder prices will be available Thursday through Monday, so if you wish to avoid the large
crowds that will assemble on Friday evening and Sunday, come at other times and identify yourself as a

22
shareholder. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. Borsheim’s operates on a gross margin that is fully
twenty percentage points below that of its major rivals, so the more you buy, the more you save (or at least
that’s what my wife and daughter tell me).

In the mall outside of Borsheim’s, we will have some of the world’s top bridge experts available to
play with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. We expect Bob Hamman, Sharon Osberg, Fred Gitelman
and Sheri Winestock to host tables. Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, will also be in the mall, taking
on all comers — blindfolded! Last year, Patrick played six games simultaneously — with his blindfold
securely in place — and for the first time suffered a loss. (He won the other five games, however.) He’s
been training overtime ever since and is planning to start a new streak this year.

Additionally, Bill Robertie, one of only two players who have twice won the backgammon world
championship, will be on hand to test your skill at that game. Finally, we will have a newcomer: Peter
Morris, the winner of the World Scrabble Championship in 1991. Peter will play on five boards
simultaneously (no blindfold for him, however) and will also allow his challengers to consult a Scrabble
dictionary.

We are also going to test your vocal chords at the mall. My friend, Al Oehrle of Philadelphia, will
be at the piano to play any song in any key. Susie and I will lead the singing. She is good.

Gorat’s — my favorite steakhouse — will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on
Sunday, May 4, and will be serving from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m. Please remember that to come to Gorat’s on
Sunday, you must have a reservation. To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 1 (but not before). If
Sunday is sold out, try Gorat’s on one of the other evenings you will be in town. Show your sophistication by
ordering a rare T-bone with a double order of hash browns.

There won’t be a ball game this year. After my fastball was clocked at 5 mph last year, I decided to
hang up my spikes. So I’ll see you on Saturday night at NFM instead.

2K 2K ok oe ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok

Next year our meeting will be held at Omaha’s new convention center. This switch in locations will
allow us to hold the event on either Saturday or Monday, whichever the majority of you prefer. Using the
enclosed special ballot, please vote for your preference — but only if-you are likely to attend in the future.

We will make the Saturday/Monday decision based upon a count of shareholders, not shares. That
is, a Class B shareholder owning one share will have a vote equal to that of a Class A shareholder owning
many shares. If the vote is close, we will go with the preference of out-of-towners.

Again, please vote only if there is a reasonable chance that you will be attending some meetings in
the future.

Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market
rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire's results
through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculated using

the numbers originally reported.

The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire
were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500
in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P in years when the index showed a
negative retum. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.

To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:

Our gain in net worth during 2003 was $13.6 billion, which increased the per-share book value of
both our Class A and Class B stock by 21%. Over the last 39 years (that is, since present management took
over) per-share book value has grown from $19 to $50,498, a rate of 22.2% compounded annually.*

It’s per-share intrinsic value that counts, however, not book value. Here, the news is good:
Between 1964 and 2003, Berkshire morphed from a struggling northern textile business whose intrinsic
value was less than book into a widely diversified enterprise worth far more than book. Our 39-year gain
in intrinsic value has therefore somewhat exceeded our 22.2% gain in book. (For a better understanding of
intrinsic value and the economic principles that guide Charlie Munger, my partner and Berkshire’s vice-
chairman, and me in running Berkshire, please read our Owner’s Manual, beginning on page 69.)

Despite their shortcomings, book value calculations are useful at Berkshire as a slightly
understated gauge for measuring the /ong-term rate of increase in our intrinsic value. The calculation is
less relevant, however, than it once was in rating any single year’s performance versus the S&P 500 index
(a comparison we display on the facing page). Our equity holdings, including convertible preferreds, have
fallen considerably as a percentage of our net worth, from an average of 114% in the 1980s, for example, to
an average of 50% in 2000-03. Therefore, yearly movements in the stock market now affect a much
smaller portion of our net worth than was once the case.

Nonetheless, Berkshire’s long-term performance versus the S&P remains all-important. Our
shareholders can buy the S&P through an index fund at very low cost. Unless we achieve gains in per-
share intrinsic value in the future that outdo the S&P’s performance, Charlie and I will be adding nothing to
what you can accomplish on your own.

If we fail, we will have no excuses. Charlie and I operate in an ideal environment. To begin with,
we are supported by an incredible group of men and women who run our operating units. If there were a
Corporate Cooperstown, its roster would surely include many of our CEOs. Any shortfall in Berkshire’s
results will not be caused by our managers.

Additionally, we enjoy a rare sort of managerial freedom. Most companies are saddled with
institutional constraints. A company’s history, for example, may commit it to an industry that now offers
limited opportunity. A more common problem is a shareholder constituency that pressures its manager to
dance to Wall Street’s tune. Many CEOs resist, but others give in and adopt operating and capital-
allocation policies far different from those they would choose if left to themselves.

At Berkshire, neither history nor the demands of owners impede intelligent decision-making.
When Charlie and I make mistakes, they are — in tennis parlance — unforced errors.

 

*All figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares, the successor to the only stock that
the company had outstanding before 1996. The B shares have an economic interest equal to 1/30" that of
the A.
Operating Earnings

When valuations are similar, we strongly prefer owning businesses to owning stocks. During
most of our years of operation, however, stocks were much the cheaper choice. We therefore sharply tilted
our asset allocation in those years toward equities, as illustrated by the percentages cited earlier.

In recent years, however, we’ve found it hard to find significantly undervalued stocks, a difficulty
greatly accentuated by the mushrooming of the funds we must deploy. Today, the number of stocks that
can be purchased in large enough quantities to move the performance needle at Berkshire is a small fraction
of the number that existed a decade ago. (Investment managers often profit far more from piling up assets
than from handling those assets well. So when one tells you that increased funds won’t hurt his investment
performance, step back: His nose is about to grow.)

The shortage of attractively-priced stocks in which we can put large sums doesn’t bother us,
providing we can find companies to purchase that (1) have favorable and enduring economic charac-
teristics; (2) are run by talented and honest managers and (3) are available at a sensible price. We have
purchased a number of such businesses in recent years, though not enough to fully employ the gusher of
cash that has come our way. In buying businesses, I’ve made some terrible mistakes, both of commission
and omission. Overall, however, our acquisitions have led to decent gains in per-share earnings.

Below is a table that quantifies that point. But first we need to warn you that growth-rate
presentations can be significantly distorted by a calculated selection of either initial or terminal dates. For
example, if earnings are tiny in a beginning year, a long-term performance that was only mediocre can be
made to appear sensational. That kind of distortion can come about because the company at issue was
minuscule in the base year — which means that only a handful of insiders actually benefited from the touted
performance — or because a larger company was then operating at just above breakeven. Picking a terminal
year that is particularly buoyant will also favorably bias a calculation of growth.

The Berkshire Hathaway that present management assumed control of in 1965 had long been
sizable. But in 1964, it earned only $175,586 or 15 cents per share, so close to breakeven that any
calculation of earnings growth from that base would be meaningless. At the time, however, even those
meager earnings looked good: Over the decade following the 1955 merger of Berkshire Fine Spinning
Associates and Hathaway Manufacturing, the combined operation had lost $10.1 million and many
thousands of employees had been let go. It was not a marriage made in heaven.

Against this background, we give you a picture of Berkshire’s earnings growth that begins in
1968, but also includes subsequent base years spaced five years apart. A series of calculations is presented
so that you can decide for yourself which period is most meaningful. I’ve started with 1968 because it was
the first full year we operated National Indemnity, the initial acquisition we made as we began to expand
Berkshire’s business.

I don’t believe that using 2003 as the terminal year distorts our calculations. It was a terrific year
for our insurance business, but the big boost that gave to earnings was largely offset by the pathetically low
interest rates we earned on our large holdings of cash equivalents (a condition that will not last). All
figures shown below, it should be noted, exc/ude capital gains.

2003 5,422.0 3,531.32
We will continue the capital allocation practices we have used in the past. If stocks become
significantly cheaper than entire businesses, we will buy them aggressively. If selected bonds become
attractive, as they did in 2002, we will again load up on these securities. Under any market or economic
conditions, we will be happy to buy businesses that meet our standards. And, for those that do, the bigger
the better. Our capital is underutilized now, but that will happen periodically. It’s a painful condition to be
in — but not as painful as doing something stupid. (I speak from experience.)

Overall, we are certain Berkshire’s performance in the future will fall far short of what it has been
in the past. Nonetheless, Charlie and I remain hopeful that we can deliver results that are modestly above
average. That’s what we’re being paid for.

Acquisitions

As regular readers know, our acquisitions have often come about in strange ways. None, however,
had a more unusual genesis than our purchase last year of Clayton Homes.

The unlikely source was a group of finance students from the University of Tennessee, and their
teacher, Dr. Al Auxier. For the past five years, Al has brought his class to Omaha, where the group tours
Nebraska Furniture Mart and Borsheim’s, eats at Gorat’s and then comes to Kiewit Plaza for a session with
me. Usually about 40 students participate.

After two hours of give-and-take, the group traditionally presents me with a thank-you gift. (The
doors stay locked until they do.) In past years it’s been items such as a football signed by Phil Fulmer and
a basketball from Tennessee’s famous women’s team.

This past February, the group opted for a book — which, luckily for me, was the recently-published
autobiography of Jim Clayton, founder of Clayton Homes. I already knew the company to be the class act
of the manufactured housing industry, knowledge I acquired after earlier making the mistake of buying
some distressed junk debt of Oakwood Homes, one of the industry’s largest companies. At the time of that
purchase, I did not understand how atrocious consumer-financing practices had become throughout most of
the manufactured housing industry. But I learned: Oakwood rather promptly went bankrupt.

Manufactured housing, it should be emphasized, can deliver very good value to home purchasers.
Indeed, for decades, the industry has accounted for more than 15% of the homes built in the U.S. During
those years, moreover, both the quality and variety of manufactured houses consistently improved.

Progress in design and construction was not matched, however, by progress in distribution and
financing. Instead, as the years went by, the industry’s business model increasingly centered on the ability
of both the retailer and manufacturer to unload terrible loans on naive lenders. When “securitization” then
became popular in the 1990s, further distancing the supplier of funds from the lending transaction, the
industry’s conduct went from bad to worse. Much of its volume a few years back came from buyers who
shouldn’t have bought, financed by lenders who shouldn’t have lent. The consequence has been huge
numbers of repossessions and pitifully low recoveries on the units repossessed.

Oakwood participated fully in the insanity. But Clayton, though it could not isolate itself from
industry practices, behaved considerably better than its major competitors.

Upon receiving Jim Clayton’s book, I told the students how much I admired his record and they
took that message back to Knoxville, home of both the University of Tennessee and Clayton Homes. Al
then suggested that I call Kevin Clayton, Jim’s son and the CEO, to express my views directly. As I talked
with Kevin, it became clear that he was both able and a straight-shooter.

Soon thereafter, I made an offer for the business based solely on Jim’s book, my evaluation of
Kevin, the public financials of Clayton and what I had learned from the Oakwood experience. Clayton’s
board was receptive, since it understood that the large-scale financing Clayton would need in the future
might be hard to get. Lenders had fled the industry and securitizations, when possible at all, carried far
more expensive and restrictive terms than was previously the case. This tightening was particularly serious
for Clayton, whose earnings significantly depended on securitizations.

Today, the manufactured housing industry remains awash in problems. Delinquencies continue
high, repossessed units still abound and the number of retailers has been halved. A different business
model is required, one that eliminates the ability of the retailer and salesman to pocket substantial money
up front by making sales financed by loans that are destined to default. Such transactions cause hardship to
both buyer and lender and lead to a flood of repossessions that then undercut the sale of new units. Under a
proper model — one requiring significant down payments and shorter-term loans — the industry will likely
remain much smaller than it was in the 90s. But it will deliver to home buyers an asset in which they will
have equity, rather than disappointment, upon resale.

In the “full circle” department, Clayton has agreed to buy the assets of Oakwood. When the
transaction closes, Clayton’s manufacturing capacity, geographical reach and sales outlets will be
substantially increased. As a byproduct, the debt of Oakwood that we own, which we bought at a deep
discount, will probably return a small profit to us.

And the students? In October, we had a surprise “graduation” ceremony in Knoxville for the 40
who sparked my interest in Clayton. I donned a mortarboard and presented each student with both a PhD
(for phenomenal, hard-working dealmaker) from Berkshire and a B share. Al got an A share. If you meet
some of the new Tennessee shareholders at our annual meeting, give them your thanks. And ask them if
they’ve read any good books lately.

In early spring, Byron Trott, a Managing Director of Goldman Sachs, told me that Wal-Mart
wished to sell its McLane subsidiary. McLane distributes groceries and nonfood items to convenience
stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs, mass merchandisers, quick service restaurants, theaters and others. It’s
a good business, but one not in the mainstream of Wal-Mart’s future. It’s made to order, however, for us.

McLane has sales of about $23 billion, but operates on paper-thin margins — about 1% pre-tax —
and will swell Berkshire’s sales figures far more than our income. In the past, some retailers had shunned
McLane because it was owned by their major competitor. Grady Rosier, McLane’s superb CEO, has
already landed some of these accounts — he was in full stride the day the deal closed — and more will come.

For several years, I have given my vote to Wal-Mart in the balloting for Fortune Magazine’s
“Most Admired” list. Our McLane transaction reinforced my opinion. To make the McLane deal, I had a
single meeting of about two hours with Tom Schoewe, Wal-Mart’s CFO, and we then shook hands. (He
did, however, first call Bentonville). Twenty-nine days later Wal-Mart had its money. We did no “due
diligence.” We knew everything would be exactly as Wal-Mart said it would be — and it was.

I should add that Byron has now been instrumental in three Berkshire acquisitions. He
understands Berkshire far better than any investment banker with whom we have talked and — it hurts me to
say this — earns his fee. I’m looking forward to deal number four (as, I am sure, is he).

Taxes

On May 20, 2003, The Washington Post ran an op-ed piece by me that was critical of the Bush tax
proposals. Thirteen days later, Pamela Olson, Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy at the U.S. Treasury,
delivered a speech about the new tax legislation saying, “That means a certain midwestern oracle, who, it
must be noted, has played the tax code like a fiddle, is still safe retaining all his earnings.” I think she was
talking about me.

Alas, my “fiddle playing” will not get me to Carnegie Hall — or even to a high school recital.
Berkshire, on your behalf and mine, will send the Treasury $3.3 billion for tax on its 2003 income, a sum
equaling 2’2% of the total income tax paid by a// U.S. corporations in fiscal 2003. (In contrast, Berkshire’s
market valuation is about 1% of the value of all American corporations.) Our payment will almost

6
certainly place us among our country’s top ten taxpayers. Indeed, if only 540 taxpayers paid the amount
Berkshire will pay, no other individual or corporation would have to pay anything to Uncle Sam. That’s
right: 290 million Americans and all other businesses would not have to pay a dime in income, social
security, excise or estate taxes to the federal government. (Here’s the math: Federal tax receipts, including
social security receipts, in fiscal 2003 totaled $1.782 trillion and 540 “Berkshires,” each paying $3.3
billion, would deliver the same $1.782 trillion.)

Our federal tax return for 2002 (2003 is not finalized), when we paid $1.75 billion, covered a mere
8,905 pages. As is required, we dutifully filed two copies of this return, creating a pile of paper seven feet
tall. At World Headquarters, our small band of 15.8, though exhausted, momentarily flushed with pride:
Berkshire, we felt, was surely pulling its share of our country’s fiscal load.

But Ms. Olson sees things otherwise. And if that means Charlie and I need to try harder, we are
ready to do so.

I do wish, however, that Ms. Olson would give me some credit for the progress I’ve already made.
In 1944, I filed my first 1040, reporting my income as a thirteen-year-old newspaper carrier. The return
covered three pages. After I claimed the appropriate business deductions, such as $35 for a bicycle, my tax
bill was $7. I sent my check to the Treasury and it — without comment — promptly cashed it. We lived in
peace.

I can understand why the Treasury is now frustrated with Corporate America and prone to
outbursts. But it should look to Congress and the Administration for redress, not to Berkshire.

Corporate income taxes in fiscal 2003 accounted for 7.4% of all federal tax receipts, down from a
post-war peak of 32% in 1952. With one exception (1983), last year’s percentage is the lowest recorded
since data was first published in 1934.

Even so, tax breaks for corporations (and their investors, particularly large ones) were a major part
of the Administration’s 2002 and 2003 initiatives. If class warfare is being waged in America, my class is
clearly winning. Today, many large corporations — run by CEOs whose fiddle-playing talents make your
Chairman look like he is all thumbs — pay nothing close to the stated federal tax rate of 35%.

In 1985, Berkshire paid $132 million in federal income taxes, and all corporations paid $61
billion. The comparable amounts in 1995 were $286 million and $157 billion respectively. And, as
mentioned, we will pay about $3.3 billion for 2003, a year when all corporations paid $132 billion. We
hope our taxes continue to rise in the future — it will mean we are prospering — but we also hope that the
rest of Corporate America antes up along with us. This might be a project for Ms. Olson to work on.

Corporate Governance

In judging whether Corporate America is serious about reforming itself; CEO pay remains the acid
test. To date, the results aren’t encouraging. A few CEOs, such as Jeff Immelt of General Electric, have
led the way in initiating programs that are fair to managers and shareholders alike. Generally, however, his
example has been more admired than followed.

It’s understandable how pay got out of hand. When management hires employees, or when
companies bargain with a vendor, the intensity of interest is equal on both sides of the table. One party’s
gain is the other party’s loss, and the money involved has real meaning to both. The result is an honest-to-
God negotiation.

But when CEOs (or their representatives) have met with compensation committees, too often one
side — the CEO’s — has cared far more than the other about what bargain is struck. A CEO, for example,
will always regard the difference between receiving options for 100,000 shares or for 500,000 as
monumental. To a comp committee, however, the difference may seem unimportant — particularly if, as

7
has been the case at most companies, neither grant will have any effect on reported earnings. Under these
conditions, the negotiation often has a “play-money” quality.

Overreaching by CEOs greatly accelerated in the 1990s as compensation packages gained by the
most avaricious— a title for which there was vigorous competition — were promptly replicated elsewhere.
The couriers for this epidemic of greed were usually consultants and human relations departments, which
had no trouble perceiving who buttered their bread. As one compensation consultant commented: “There
are two classes of clients you don’t want to offend — actual and potential.”

In proposals for reforming this malfunctioning system, the cry has been for “independent”
directors. But the question of what truly motivates independence has largely been neglected.

In last year’s report, I took a look at how “independent” directors — as defined by statute — had
performed in the mutual fund field. The Investment Company Act of 1940 mandated such directors, and
that means we’ve had an extended test of what statutory standards produce. In our examination last year,
we looked at the record of fund directors in respect to the two key tasks board members should perform —
whether at a mutual fund business or any other. These two all-important functions are, first, to obtain (or
retain) an able and honest manager and then to compensate that manager fairly.

Our survey was not encouraging. Year after year, at literally thousands of funds, directors had
routinely rehired the incumbent management company, however pathetic its performance had been. Just as
routinely, the directors had mindlessly approved fees that in many cases far exceeded those that could have
been negotiated. Then, when a management company was sold — invariably at a huge price relative to
tangible assets — the directors experienced a “counter-revelation” and immediately signed on with the new
manager and accepted its fee schedule. In effect, the directors decided that whoever would pay the most
for the old management company was the party that should manage the shareholders’ money in the future.

Despite the lapdog behavior of independent fund directors, we did not conclude that they are bad
people. They’re not. But sadly, “boardroom atmosphere” almost invariably sedates their fiduciary genes.

On May 22, 2003, not long after Berkshire’s report appeared, the Chairman of the Investment
Company Institute addressed its membership about “The State of our Industry.” Responding to those who
have “weighed in about our perceived failings,” he mused, “It makes me wonder what life would be like if
we’d actually done something wrong.”

Be careful what you wish for.

Within a few months, the world began to learn that many fund-management companies had
followed policies that hurt the owners of the funds they managed, while simultaneously boosting the fees of
the managers. Prior to their transgressions, it should be noted, these management companies were earning
profit margins and returns on tangible equity that were the envy of Corporate America. Yet to swell profits
further, they trampled on the interests of fund shareholders in an appalling manner.

So what are the directors of these looted funds doing? As I write this, I have seen none that have
terminated the contract of the offending management company (though naturally that entity has often fired
some of its employees). Can you imagine directors who had been personally defrauded taking such a boys-
will-be-boys attitude?

To top it all off, at least one miscreant management company has put itself up for sale,
undoubtedly hoping to receive a huge sum for “delivering” the mutual funds it has managed to the highest
bidder among other managers. This is a travesty. Why in the world don’t the directors of those funds
simply select whomever they think is best among the bidding organizations and sign up with that party
directly? The winner would consequently be spared a huge “payoff” to the former manager who, having
flouted the principles of stewardship, deserves not a dime. Not having to bear that acquisition cost, the
winner could surely manage the funds in question for a far lower ongoing fee than would otherwise have
been the case. Any truly independent director should insist on this approach to obtaining a new manager.
The reality is that neither the decades-old rules regulating investment company directors nor the
new rules bearing down on Corporate America foster the election of truly independent directors. In both
instances, an individual who is receiving 100% of his income from director fees — and who may wish to
enhance his income through election to other boards — is deemed independent. That is nonsense. The same
rules say that Berkshire director and lawyer Ron Olson, who receives from us perhaps 3% of his very large
income, does not qualify as independent because that 3% comes from legal fees Berkshire pays his firm
rather than from fees he earns as a Berkshire director. Rest assured, 3% from any source would not torpedo
Ron’s independence. But getting 20%, 30% or 50% of their income from director fees might well temper
the independence of many individuals, particularly if their overall income is not large. Indeed, I think it’s
clear that at mutual funds, it has.

2K 2K 2K ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok

Let me make a small suggestion to “independent” mutual fund directors. Why not simply affirm
in each annual report that “(1) We have looked at other management companies and believe the one we
have retained for the upcoming year is among the better operations in the field; and (2) we have negotiated
a fee with our managers comparable to what other clients with equivalent funds would negotiate.”

It does not seem unreasonable for shareholders to expect fund directors — who are often receiving
fees that exceed $100,000 annually — to declare themselves on these points. Certainly these directors
would satisfy themselves on both matters were they handing over a large chunk of their own money to the
manager. If directors are unwilling to make these two declarations, shareholders should heed the maxim
“Tf you don’t know whose side someone is on, he’s probably not on yours.”

Finally, a disclaimer. A great many funds have been run well and conscientiously despite the
opportunities for malfeasance that exist. The shareholders of these funds have benefited, and their
managers have earned their pay. Indeed, if I were a director of certain funds, including some that charge
above-average fees, I would enthusiastically make the two declarations I have suggested. Additionally,
those index funds that are very low-cost (such as Vanguard’s) are investor-friendly by definition and are
the best selection for most of those who wish to own equities.

I am on my soapbox now only because the blatant wrongdoing that has occurred has betrayed the
trust of so many millions of shareholders. Hundreds of industry insiders had to know what was going on,
yet none publicly said a word. It took Eliot Spitzer, and the whistleblowers who aided him, to initiate a
housecleaning. We urge fund directors to continue the job. Like directors throughout Corporate America,
these fiduciaries must now decide whether their job is to work for owners or for managers.

Berkshire Governance

True independence — meaning the willingness to challenge a forceful CEO when something is
wrong or foolish — is an enormously valuable trait in a director. It is also rare. The place to look for it is
among high-grade people whose interests are in line with those of rank-and-file shareholders — and are in
line in a very big way.

We’ve made that search at Berkshire. We now have eleven directors and each of them, combined
with members of their families, owns more than $4 million of Berkshire stock. Moreover, all have held
major stakes in Berkshire for many years. In the case of six of the eleven, family ownership amounts to at
least hundreds of millions and dates back at least three decades. All eleven directors purchased their
holdings in the market just as you did; we’ve never passed out options or restricted shares. Charlie and I
love such honest-to-God ownership. After all, who ever washes a rental car?

In addition, director fees at Berkshire are nominal (as my son, Howard, periodically reminds me).
Thus, the upside from Berkshire for all eleven is proportionately the same as the upside for any Berkshire
shareholder. And it always will be.
The downside for Berkshire directors is actually worse than yours because we carry no directors
and officers liability insurance. Therefore, if something really catastrophic happens on our directors’
watch, they are exposed to losses that will far exceed yours.

The bottom line for our directors: You win, they win big; you lose, they lose big. Our approach
might be called owner-capitalism. We know of no better way to engender true independence. (This
structure does not guarantee perfect behavior, however: I’ve sat on boards of companies in which Berkshire
had huge stakes and remained silent as questionable proposals were rubber-stamped. )

In addition to being independent, directors should have business savvy, a shareholder orientation
and a genuine interest in the company. The rarest of these qualities is business savvy — and if it is lacking,
the other two are of little help. Many people who are smart, articulate and admired have no real
understanding of business. That’s no sin; they may shine elsewhere. But they don’t belong on corporate
boards. Similarly, I would be useless on a medical or scientific board (though I would likely be welcomed
by a chairman who wanted to run things his way). My name would dress up the list of directors, but I
wouldn’t know enough to critically evaluate proposals. Moreover, to cloak my ignorance, I would keep my
mouth shut (if you can imagine that). In effect, I could be replaced, without loss, by a potted plant.

Last year, as we moved to change our board, I asked for self-nominations from shareholders who
believed they had the requisite qualities to be a Berkshire director. Despite the lack of either liability
insurance or meaningful compensation, we received more than twenty applications. Most were good,
coming from owner-oriented individuals having family holdings of Berkshire worth well over $1 million.
After considering them, Charlie and I — with the concurrence of our incumbent directors — asked four
shareholders who did not nominate themselves to join the board: David Gottesman, Charlotte Guyman,
Don Keough and Tom Murphy. These four people are all friends of mine, and I know their strengths well.
They bring an extraordinary amount of business talent to Berkshire’s board.

The primary job of our directors is to select my successor, either upon my death or disability, or
when I begin to lose my marbles. (David Ogilvy had it right when he said: “Develop your eccentricities
when young. That way, when you get older, people won’t think you are going gaga.” Charlie’s family and
mine feel that we overreacted to David’s advice.)

At our directors’ meetings we cover the usual run of housekeeping matters. But the real
discussion — both with me in the room and absent — centers on the strengths and weaknesses of the four
internal candidates to replace me.

Our board knows that the ultimate scorecard on its performance will be determined by the record
of my successor. He or she will need to maintain Berkshire’s culture, allocate capital and keep a group of
America’s best managers happy in their jobs. This isn’t the toughest task in the world — the train is already
moving at a good clip down the track — and I’m totally comfortable about it being done well by any of the
four candidates we have identified. I have more than 99% of my net worth in Berkshire and will be happy
to have my wife or foundation (depending on the order in which she and I die) continue this concentration.

Sector Results

As managers, Charlie and I want to give our owners the financial information and commentary we
would wish to receive if our roles were reversed. To do this with both clarity and reasonable brevity
becomes more difficult as Berkshire’s scope widens. Some of our businesses have vastly different
economic characteristics from others, which means that our consolidated statements, with their jumble of
figures, make useful analysis almost impossible.

On the following pages, therefore, we will present some balance sheet and earnings figures from
our four major categories of businesses along with commentary about each. We particularly want you to
understand the limited circumstances under which we will use debt, since typically we shun it. We will
not, however, inundate you with data that has no real value in calculating Berkshire’s intrinsic value.
Doing so would likely obfuscate the most important facts. One warning: When analyzing Berkshire, be

10
sure to remember that the company should be viewed as an unfolding movie, not as a still photograph.
Those who focused in the past on only the snapshot of the day sometimes reached erroneous conclusions.

Insurance
Let’s start with insurance — since that’s where the money is.

The fountain of funds we enjoy in our insurance operations comes from “float,” which is money
that doesn’t belong to us but that we temporarily hold. Most of our float arises because (1) premiums are
paid upfront though the service we provide — insurance protection — is delivered over a period that usually
covers a year and; (2) loss events that occur today do not always result in our immediately paying claims,
since it sometimes takes years for losses to be reported (think asbestos), negotiated and settled.

Float is wonderful — if it doesn’t come at a high price. The cost of float is determined by
underwriting results, meaning how losses and expenses paid compare with premiums received. The
property-casualty industry as a whole regularly operates at a substantial underwriting loss, and therefore
often has a cost of float that is unattractive.

Overall, our results have been good. True, we’ve had five terrible years in which float cost us
more than 10%. But in 18 of the 37 years Berkshire has been in the insurance business, we have operated
at an underwriting profit, meaning we were actually paid for holding money. And the quantity of this
cheap money has grown far beyond what I dreamed it could when we entered the business in 1967.

Last year was a standout. Float reached record levels and it came without cost as all major
segments contributed to Berkshire’s $1.7 billion pre-tax underwriting profit.

Our results have been exceptional for one reason: We have truly exceptional managers. Insurers
sell a non-proprietary piece of paper containing a non-proprietary promise. Anyone can copy anyone else’s
product. No installed base, key patents, critical real estate or natural resource position protects an insurer’s
competitive position. Typically, brands do not mean much either.

The critical variables, therefore, are managerial brains, discipline and integrity. Our managers
have all of these attributes — in spades. Let’s take a look at these all-stars and their operations.

e General Re had been Berkshire’s problem child in the years following our acquisition of it in
1998. Unfortunately, it was a 400-pound child, and its negative impact on our overall
performance was large.

That’s behind us: Gen Re is fixed. Thank Joe Brandon, its CEO, and his partner, Tad

Montross, for that. When I wrote you last year, I thought that discipline had been restored to
both underwriting and reserving, and events during 2003 solidified my view.

11
That does not mean we will never have setbacks. Reinsurance is a business that is certain to
deliver blows from time to time. But, under Joe and Tad, this operation will be a powerful
engine driving Berkshire’s future profitability.

Gen Re’s financial strength, unmatched among reinsurers even as we started 2003, further
improved during the year. Many of the company’s competitors suffered credit downgrades
last year, leaving Gen Re, and its sister operation at National Indemnity, as the only AAA-
rated companies among the world’s major reinsurers.

When insurers purchase reinsurance, they buy only a promise — one whose validity may not
be tested for decades — and there are no promises in the reinsurance world equaling those
offered by Gen Re and National Indemnity. Furthermore, unlike most reinsurers, we retain
virtually all of the risks we assume. Therefore, our ability to pay is not dependent on the
ability or willingness of others to reimburse us. This independent financial strength could be
enormously important when the industry experiences the mega-catastrophe it surely will.

Regular readers of our annual reports know of Ajit Jain’s incredible contributions to
Berkshire’s prosperity over the past 18 years. He continued to pour it on in 2003. With a
staff of only 23, Ajit runs one of the world’s largest reinsurance operations, specializing in
mammoth and unusual risks.

Often, these involve assuming catastrophe risks — say, the threat of a large California
earthquake — of a size far greater than any other reinsurer will accept. This means Ajit’s
results (and Berkshire’s) will be lumpy. You should, therefore, expect his operation to have
an occasional horrible year. Over time, however, you can be confident of a terrific result from
this one-of-a-kind manager.

Ajit writes some very unusual policies. Last year, for example, PepsiCo promoted a drawing
that offered participants a chance to win a $1 billion prize. Understandably, Pepsi wished to
lay off this risk, and we were the logical party to assume it. So we wrote a $1 billion policy,
retaining the risk entirely for our own account. Because the prize, if won, was payable over
time, our exposure in present-value terms was $250 million. (I helpfully suggested that any
winner be paid $1 a year for a billion years, but that proposal didn’t fly.) The drawing was
held on September 14. Ajit and I held our breath, as did the finalist in the contest, and we left
happier than he. PepsiCo has renewed for a repeat contest in 2004.

GEICO was a fine insurance company when Tony Nicely took over as CEO in 1992. Now it
is a great one. During his tenure, premium volume has increased from $2.2 billion to $8.1
billion, and our share of the personal-auto market has grown from 2.1% to 5.0%. More
important, GEICO has paired these gains with outstanding underwriting performance.

It’s been 67 years since Leo Goodwin created a great business idea at GEICO, one designed
to save policyholders significant money. Go to Geico.com or call 1-800-847-7536 to see
what we can do for you.

(End of commercial)

In 2003, both the number of inquiries coming into GEICO and its closure rate on these
increased significantly. As a result our preferred policyholder count grew 8.2%, and our
standard and non-standard policies grew 21.4%.

GEICO’s business growth creates a never-ending need for more employees and facilities.
Our most recent expansion, announced in December, is a customer service center in — I’m
delighted to say — Buffalo. Stan Lipsey, the publisher of our Buffalo News, was instrumental
in bringing the city and GEICO together.

12
The key figure in this matter, however, was Governor George Pataki. His leadership and
tenacity are why Buffalo will have 2,500 new jobs when our expansion is fully rolled out.
Stan, Tony, and I — along with Buffalo — thank him for his help.

e ~Berkshire’s smaller insurers had another terrific year. This group, run by Rod Eldred, John
Kizer, Tom Nerney, Don Towle and Don Wurster, increased its float by 41%, while
delivering an excellent underwriting profit. These men, though operating in unexciting ways,
produce truly exciting results.

2K 2K ok ok ok ok ok Ok ok ok ok Ok

We should point out again that in any given year a company writing long-tail insurance (coverages
giving rise to claims that are often settled many years after the loss-causing event takes place) can report
almost any earnings that the CEO desires. Too often the industry has reported wildly inaccurate figures by
misstating liabilities. Most of the mistakes have been innocent. Sometimes, however, they have been
intentional, their object being to fool investors and regulators. Auditors and actuaries have usually failed to
prevent both varieties of misstatement.

I have failed on occasion too, particularly in not spotting Gen Re’s unwitting underreserving a few
years back. Not only did that mean we reported inaccurate figures to you, but the error also resulted in our

paying very substantial taxes earlier than was necessary. Aaarrrggghh. I told you last year, however, that I
thought our current reserving was at appropriate levels. So far, that judgment is holding up.

Here are Berkshire’s pre-tax underwriting results by segment:

*These contracts were explained on page 10 of the 2002 annual report, available on the Internet at
www.berkshirehathaway.com. In brief, this segment consists of a few jumbo policies that are likely to
produce underwriting losses (which are capped) but also provide unusually large amounts of float.

Regulated Utility Businesses

Through MidAmerican Energy Holdings, we own an 80.5% (fully diluted) interest in a wide
variety of utility operations. The largest are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, whose 3.7
million electric customers make it the third largest distributor of electricity in the U.K.; (2) MidAmerican
Energy, which serves 689,000 electric customers in Iowa and; (3) Kern River and Northern Natural
pipelines, which carry 7.8% of the natural gas transported in the United States.

Berkshire has three partners, who own the remaining 19.5%: Dave Sokol and Greg Abel, the
brilliant managers of the business, and Walter Scott, a long-time friend of mine who introduced me to the
company. Because MidAmerican is subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act (““PUHCA”),
Berkshire’s voting interest is limited to 9.9%. Walter has the controlling vote.

Our limited voting interest forces us to account for MidAmerican in our financial statements in an

abbreviated manner. Instead of our fully including its assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our
statements, we record only a one-line entry in both our balance sheet and income account. It’s likely that

13
some day, perhaps soon, either PUHCA will be repealed or accounting rules will change. Berkshire’s
consolidated figures would then take in all of MidAmerican, including the substantial debt it utilizes.

The size of this debt (which is not now, nor will it be, an obligation of Berkshire) is entirely
appropriate. MidAmerican’s diverse and stable utility operations assure that, even under harsh economic
conditions, aggregate earnings will be ample to very comfortably service all debt.

At yearend, $1.578 billion of MidAmerican’s most junior debt was payable to Berkshire. This
debt has allowed acquisitions to be financed without our three partners needing to increase their already
substantial investments in MidAmerican. By charging 11% interest, Berkshire is compensated fairly for
putting up the funds needed for purchases, while our partners are spared dilution of their equity interests.

MidAmerican also owns a significant non-utility business, Home Services of America, the second
largest real estate broker in the country. Unlike our utility operations, this business is highly cyclical, but
nevertheless one we view enthusiastically. We have an exceptional manager, Ron Peltier, who, through
both his acquisition and operational skills, is building a brokerage powerhouse.

Last year, Home Services participated in $48.6 billion of transactions, a gain of $11.7 billion from
2002. About 23% of the increase came from four acquisitions made during the year. Through our 16
brokerage firms — all of which retain their local identities — we employ 16,343 brokers in 16 states. Home
Services is almost certain to grow substantially in the next decade as we continue to acquire leading
localized operations.

Here’s a tidbit for fans of free enterprise. On March 31, 1990, the day electric utilities in the U.K.
were denationalized, Northern and Yorkshire had 6,800 employees in functions these companies continue
today to perform. Now they employ 2,539. Yet the companies are serving about the same number of
customers as when they were government owned and are distributing more electricity.

This is not, it should be noted, a trrumph of deregulation. Prices and earnings continue to be
regulated in a fair manner by the government, just as they should be. Itis a victory, however, for those who
believe that profit-motivated managers, even though they recognize that the benefits will largely flow to
customers, will find efficiencies that government never will.

Here are some key figures on MidAmerican’s operations:

Finance and Financial Products

This sector includes a wide-ranging group of activities. Here’s some commentary on the most
important.

e I manage a few opportunistic strategies in AAA fixed-income securities that have been quite
profitable in the last few years. These opportunities come and go — and at present, they are
going. We sped their departure somewhat last year, thereby realizing 24% of the capital gains
we show in the table that follows.

Though far from foolproof, these transactions involve no credit risk and are conducted in
exceptionally liquid securities. We therefore finance the positions almost entirely with
borrowed money. As the assets are reduced, so also are the borrowings. The smaller
portfolio we now have means that in the near future our earnings in this category will decline
significantly. It was fun while it lasted, and at some point we’ll get another turn at bat.

eA far less pleasant unwinding operation is taking place at Gen Re Securities, the trading and
derivatives operation we inherited when we purchased General Reinsurance.

When we began to liquidate Gen Re Securities in early 2002, it had 23,218 outstanding tickets
with 884 counterparties (some having names I couldn’t pronounce, much _ less
creditworthiness I could evaluate). Since then, the unit’s managers have been skillful and
diligent in unwinding positions. Yet, at yearend — nearly two years later — we still had 7,580
tickets outstanding with 453 counterparties. (As the country song laments, “How can I miss
you if you won’t go away?”)

The shrinking of this business has been costly. We’ve had pre-tax losses of $173 million in
2002 and $99 million in 2003. These losses, it should be noted, came from a portfolio of
contracts that — in full compliance with GAAP — had been regularly marked-to-market with
standard allowances for future credit-loss and administrative costs. Moreover, our liquidation
has taken place both in a benign market — we’ve had no credit losses of significance — and in
an orderly manner. This is just the opposite of what might be expected if a financial crisis
forced a number of derivatives dealers to cease operations simultaneously.

If our derivatives experience — and the Freddie Mac shenanigans of mind-blowing size and
audacity that were revealed last year — makes you suspicious of accounting in this arena,
consider yourself wised up. No matter how financially sophisticated you are, you can’t
possibly learn from reading the disclosure documents of a derivatives-intensive company
what risks lurk in its positions. Indeed, the more you know about derivatives, the less you
will feel you can learn from the disclosures normally proffered you. In Darwin’s words,
“Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge.”

2K 2K ok ok Ok ok ok ok ok ok ok Ok

And now it’s confession time: I’m sure I could have saved you $100 million or so, pre-tax, if I
had acted more promptly to shut down Gen Re Securities. Both Charlie and I knew at the
time of the General Reinsurance merger that its derivatives business was unattractive.
Reported profits struck us as illusory, and we felt that the business carried sizable risks that
could not effectively be measured or limited. Moreover, we knew that any major problems
the operation might experience would likely correlate with troubles in the financial or
insurance world that would affect Berkshire elsewhere. In other words, if the derivatives
business were ever to need shoring up, it would commandeer the capital and credit of
Berkshire at just the time we could otherwise deploy those resources to huge advantage. (A
historical note: We had just such an experience in 1974 when we were the victim of a major
insurance fraud. We could not determine for some time how much the fraud would ultimately
cost us and therefore kept more funds in cash-equivalents than we normally would have.

15
Absent this precaution, we would have made larger purchases of stocks that were then
extraordinarily cheap. )

Charlie would have moved swiftly to close down Gen Re Securities — no question about that.
I, however, dithered. As a consequence, our shareholders are paying a far higher price than
was necessary to exit this business.

Though we include Gen Re’s sizable life and health reinsurance business in the “insurance”
sector, we show the results for Ajit Jain’s life and annuity business in this section. That’s
because this business, in large part, involves arbitraging money. Our annuities range from a
retail product sold directly on the Internet to structured settlements that require us to make
payments for 70 years or more to people severely injured in accidents.

We’ ve realized some extra income in this business because of accelerated principal payments
we received from certain fixed-income securities we had purchased at discounts. This
phenomenon has ended, and earnings are therefore likely to be lower in this segment during
the next few years.

We have a $604 million investment in Value Capital, a partnership run by Mark Byrne, a
member of a family that has helped Berkshire over the years in many ways. Berkshire is a
limited partner in, and has no say in the management of, Mark’s enterprise, which specializes
in highly-hedged fixed-income opportunities. Mark is smart and honest and, along with his
family, has a significant investment in Value.

Because of accounting abuses at Enron and elsewhere, rules will soon be instituted that are
likely to require that Value’s assets and liabilities be consolidated on Berkshire’s balance
sheet. We regard this requirement as inappropriate, given that Value’s liabilities — which
usually are above $20 billion — are in no way ours. Over time, other investors will join us as
partners in Value. When enough do, the need for us to consolidate Value will disappear.

We have told you in the past about Berkadia, the partnership we formed three years ago with
Leucadia to finance and manage the wind-down of Finova, a bankrupt lending operation. The
plan was that we would supply most of the capital and Leucadia would supply most of the
brains. And that’s the way it has worked. Indeed, Joe Steinberg and Ian Cumming, who
together run Leucadia, have done such a fine job in liquidating Finova’s portfolio that the $5.6
billion guarantee we took on in connection with the transaction has been extinguished. The
unfortunate byproduct of this fast payoff is that our future income will be much reduced.
Overall, Berkadia has made excellent money for us, and Joe and Jan have been terrific
partners.

Our leasing businesses are XTRA (transportation equipment) and CORT (office furniture).
Both operations have had poor earnings during the past two years as the recession caused
demand to drop considerably more than was anticipated. They remain leaders in their fields,
and I expect at least a modest improvement in their earnings this year.

Through our Clayton purchase, we acquired a significant manufactured-housing finance
operation. Clayton, like others in this business, had traditionally securitized the loans it
originated. The practice relieved stress on Clayton’s balance sheet, but a by-product was the
“front-ending” of income (a result dictated by GAAP).

We are in no hurry to record income, have enormous balance-sheet strength, and believe that
over the long-term the economics of holding our consumer paper are superior to what we can
now realize through securitization. So Clayton has begun to retain its loans.

We believe it’s appropriate to finance a soundly-selected book of interest-bearing receivables
almost entirely with debt (just as a bank would). Therefore, Berkshire will borrow money to
finance Clayton’s portfolio and re-lend these funds to Clayton at our cost plus one percentage

16
point. This markup fairly compensates Berkshire for putting its exceptional creditworthiness
to work, but it still delivers money to Clayton at an attractive price.

In 2003, Berkshire did $2 billion of such borrowing and re-lending, with Clayton using much
of this money to fund several large purchases of portfolios from lenders exiting the business.
A portion of our loans to Clayton also provided “catch-up” funding for paper it had generated
earlier in the year from its own operation and had found difficult to securitize.

You may wonder why we borrow money while sitting on a mountain of cash. It’s because of
our “every tub on its own bottom” philosophy. We believe that any subsidiary lending money
should pay an appropriate rate for the funds needed to carry its receivables and should not be
subsidized by its parent. Otherwise, having a rich daddy can lead to sloppy decisions.
Meanwhile, the cash we accumulate at Berkshire is destined for business acquisitions or for
the purchase of securities that offer opportunities for significant profit. Clayton’s loan
portfolio will likely grow to at least $5 billion in not too many years and, with sensible credit
standards in place, should deliver significant earnings.

For simplicity’s sake, we include all of Clayton’s earnings in this sector, though a sizable
portion is derived from areas other than consumer finance.

This eclectic group, which sells products ranging from Dilly Bars to B-737s, earned a hefty 20.7%

on average tangible net worth last year. However, we purchased these businesses at substantial premiums
to net worth — that fact is reflected in the goodwill item shown on the balance sheet — and that reduces the

* From date of acquisition, May 23, 2003.

Three of our building-materials businesses — Acme Brick, Benjamin Moore and MiTek — had record
operating earnings last year. And earnings at Johns Manville, the fourth, were trending upward at
yearend. Collectively, these companies earned 21.0% on tangible net worth.

Shaw Industries, the world’s largest manufacturer of broadloom carpet, also had a record year. Led by
Bob Shaw, who built this huge enterprise from a standing start, the company will likely set another
earnings record in 2004. In November, Shaw acquired various carpet operations from Dixie Group,
which should add about $240 million to sales this year, boosting Shaw’s volume to nearly $5 billion.

Within the apparel group, Fruit of the Loom is our largest operation. Fruit has three major assets: a
148-year-old universally-recognized brand, a low-cost manufacturing operation, and John Holland, its
CEO. In 2003, Fruit accounted for 42.3% of the men’s and boys’ underwear that was sold by mass
marketers (Wal-Mart, Target, K-Mart, etc.) and increased its share of the women’s and girls’ business
in that channel to 13.9%, up from 11.3% in 2002.

In retailing, our furniture group earned $106 million pre-tax, our jewelers $59 million and See’s, which
is both a manufacturer and retailer, $59 million.

Both R.C. Willey and Nebraska Furniture Mart (“NFM”) opened hugely successful stores last year,
Willey in Las Vegas and NFM in Kansas City, Kansas. Indeed, we believe the Kansas City store is the
country’s largest-volume home-furnishings store. (Our Omaha operation, while located on a single
plot of land, consists of three units.)

18
NFM was founded by Rose Blumkin (“Mrs. B’”) in 1937 with $500. She worked until she was 103
(hmmm .. . not a bad idea). One piece of wisdom she imparted to the generations following her was,
“If you have the lowest price, customers will find you at the bottom of a river.” Our store serving
greater Kansas City, which is located in one of the area’s more sparsely populated parts, has proved
Mrs. B’s point. Though we have more than 25 acres of parking, the lot has at times overflowed.

“Victory,” President Kennedy told us after the Bay of Pigs disaster, “has a thousand fathers, but defeat
is an orphan.” At NFM, we knew we had a winner a month after the boffo opening in Kansas City,
when our new store attracted an unexpected paternity claim. A speaker there, referring to the Blumkin
family, asserted, “They had enough confidence and the policies of the Administration were working
such that they were able to provide work for 1,000 of our fellow citizens.” The proud papa at the
podium? President George W. Bush.

In flight services, FlightSafety, our training operation, experienced a drop in “normal” operating
earnings from $183 million to $150 million. (The abnormals: In 2002 we had a $60 million pre-tax
gain from the sale of a partnership interest to Boeing, and in 2003 we recognized a $37 million loss
stemming from the premature obsolescence of simulators.) The corporate aviation business has slowed
significantly in the past few years, and this fact has hurt FlightSafety’s results. The company
continues, however, to be far and away the leader in its field. Its simulators have an original cost of
$1.2 billion, which is more than triple the cost of those operated by our closest competitor.

NetJets, our fractional-ownership operation lost $41 million pre-tax in 2003. The company had a
modest operating profit in the U.S., but this was more than offset by a $32 million loss on aircraft
inventory and by continued losses in Europe.

NetJets continues to dominate the fractional-ownership field, and its lead is increasing: Prospects
overwhelmingly turn to us rather than to our three major competitors. Last year, among the four of us,
we accounted for 70% of net sales (measured by value).

An example of what sets NetJets apart from competitors is our Mayo Clinic Executive Travel
Response program, a free benefit enjoyed by all of our owners. On land or in the air, anywhere in the
world and at any hour of any day, our owners and their families have an immediate link to Mayo.
Should an emergency occur while they are traveling here or abroad, Mayo will instantly direct them to
an appropriate doctor or hospital. Any baseline data about the patient that Mayo possesses is
simultaneously made available to the treating physician. Many owners have already found this service
invaluable, including one who needed emergency brain surgery in Eastern Europe.

The $32 million inventory write-down we took in 2003 occurred because of falling prices for used
aircraft early in the year. Specifically, we bought back fractions from withdrawing owners at
prevailing prices, and these fell in value before we were able to remarket them. Prices are now stable.

The European loss is painful. But any company that forsakes Europe, as all of our competitors have
done, is destined for second-tier status. Many of our U.S. owners fly extensively in Europe and want
the safety and security assured by a NetJets plane and pilots. Despite a slow start, furthermore, we are
now adding European customers at a good pace. During the years 2001 through 2003, we had gains of
88%, 61% and 77% in European management-and-flying revenues. We have not, however, yet
succeeded in stemming the flow of red ink.

Rich Santulli, NetJets’ extraordinary CEO, and I expect our European loss to diminish in 2004 and also
anticipate that it will be more than offset by U.S. profits. Overwhelmingly, our owners love the
NetJets experience. Once a customer has tried us, going back to commercial aviation is like going
back to holding hands. NetJets will become a very big business over time and will be one in which we
are preeminent in both customer satisfaction and profits. Rich will see to that.

We bought some Wells Fargo shares last year. Otherwise, among our six largest holdings, we last
changed our position in Coca-Cola in 1994, American Express in 1998, Gillette in 1989, Washington Post
in 1973, and Moody’s in 2000. Brokers don’t love us.

We are neither enthusiastic nor negative about the portfolio we hold. We own pieces of excellent
businesses — all of which had good gains in intrinsic value last year — but their current prices reflect their
excellence. The unpleasant corollary to this conclusion is that I made a big mistake in not selling several of
our larger holdings during The Great Bubble. If these stocks are fully priced now, you may wonder what I
was thinking four years ago when their intrinsic value was lower and their prices far higher. So do I.

In 2002, junk bonds became very cheap, and we purchased about $8 billion of these. The
pendulum swung quickly though, and this sector now looks decidedly unattractive to us. Yesterday’s
weeds are today being priced as flowers.

We’ve repeatedly emphasized that realized gains at Berkshire are meaningless for analytical
purposes. We have a huge amount of unrealized gains on our books, and our thinking about when, and if,
to cash them depends not at all on a desire to report earnings at one specific time or another. Nevertheless,
to see the diversity of our investment activities, you may be interested in the following table, categorizing
the gains we reported during 2003:

The common stock profits occurred around the edges of our portfolio — not, as we already
mentioned, from our selling down our major positions. The profits in governments arose from our

20
liquidation of long-term strips (the most volatile of government securities) and from certain strategies I
follow within our finance and financial products division. We retained most of our junk portfolio, selling
only a few issues. Calls and maturing bonds accounted for the rest of the gains in the junk category.

During 2002 we entered the foreign currency market for the first time in my life, and in 2003 we
enlarged our position, as I became increasingly bearish on the dollar. I should note that the cemetery for
seers has a huge section set aside for macro forecasters. We have in fact made few macro forecasts at
Berkshire, and we have seldom seen others make them with sustained success.

We have — and will continue to have — the bulk of Berkshire’s net worth in U.S. assets. But in
recent years our country’s trade deficit has been force-feeding huge amounts of claims on, and ownership
in, America to the rest of the world. For a time, foreign appetite for these assets readily absorbed the
supply. Late in 2002, however, the world started choking on this diet, and the dollar’s value began to slide
against major currencies. Even so, prevailing exchange rates will not lead to a material letup in our trade
deficit. So whether foreign investors like it or not, they will continue to be flooded with dollars. The
consequences of this are anybody’s guess. They could, however, be troublesome — and reach, in fact, well
beyond currency markets.

As an American, I hope there is a benign ending to this problem. I myself suggested one possible
solution — which, incidentally, leaves Charlie cold — in a November 10, 2003 article in Fortune Magazine.
Then again, perhaps the alarms I have raised will prove needless: Our country’s dynamism and resiliency
have repeatedly made fools of naysayers. But Berkshire holds many billions of cash-equivalents
denominated in dollars. So I feel more comfortable owning foreign-exchange contracts that are at least a
partial offset to that position.

These contracts are subject to accounting rules that require changes in their value to be
contemporaneously included in capital gains or losses, even though the contracts have not been closed. We
show these changes each quarter in the Finance and Financial Products segment of our earnings statement.
At yearend, our open foreign exchange contracts totaled about $12 billion at market values and were spread
among five currencies. Also, when we were purchasing junk bonds in 2002, we tried when possible to buy
issues denominated in Euros. Today, we own about $1 billion of these.

When we can’t find anything exciting in which to invest, our “default” position is U.S. Treasuries,
both bills and repos. No matter how low the yields on these instruments go, we never “reach” for a little
more income by dropping our credit standards or by extending maturities. Charlie and I detest taking even
small risks unless we feel we are being adequately compensated for doing so. About as far as we will go
down that path is to occasionally eat cottage cheese a day after the expiration date on the carton.

A 2003 book that investors can learn much from is Bull! by Maggie Mahar. Two other books I’d
recommend are The Smartest Guys in the Room by Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind, and Jn an Uncertain
World by Bob Rubin. All three are well-reported and well-written. Additionally, Jason Zweig last year did
a first-class job in revising The Intelligent Investor, my favorite book on investing.

Designated Gifts Program

From 1981 through 2002, Berkshire administered a program whereby shareholders could direct
Berkshire to make gifts to their favorite charitable organizations. Over the years we disbursed $197 million
pursuant to this program. Churches were the most frequently named designees, and many thousands of
other organizations benefited as well. We were the only major public company that offered such a program
to shareholders, and Charlie and I were proud of it.

We reluctantly terminated the program in 2003 because of controversy over the abortion issue.
Over the years numerous organizations on both sides of this issue had been designated by our shareholders
to receive contributions. As a result, we regularly received some objections to the gifts designated for pro-
choice operations. A few of these came from people and organizations that proceeded to boycott products

21
of our subsidiaries. That did not concern us. We refused all requests to limit the right of our owners to
make whatever gifts they chose (as long as the recipients had 501(c)(3) status).

In 2003, however, many independent associates of The Pampered Chef began to feel the boycotts.
This development meant that people who trusted us — but who were neither employees of ours nor had a
voice in Berkshire decision-making — suffered serious losses of income.

For our shareholders, there was some modest tax efficiency in Berkshire doing the giving rather
than their making their gifts directly. Additionally, the program was consistent with our “partnership”
approach, the first principle set forth in our Owner’s Manual. But these advantages paled when they were
measured against damage done loyal associates who had with great personal effort built businesses of their
own. Indeed, Charlie and I see nothing charitable in harming decent, hard-working people just so we and
other shareholders can gain some minor tax efficiencies.

Berkshire now makes no contributions at the parent company level. Our various subsidiaries
follow philanthropic policies consistent with their practices prior to their acquisition by Berkshire, except
that any personal contributions that former owners had earlier made from their corporate pocketbook are
now funded by them personally.

The Annual Meeting

Last year, I asked you to vote as to whether you wished our annual meeting to be held on Saturday
or Monday. I was hoping for Monday. Saturday won by 2 to 1. It will be a while before shareholder
democracy resurfaces at Berkshire.

But you have spoken, and we will hold this year’s annual meeting on Saturday, May 1 at the new
Qwest Center in downtown Omaha. The Qwest offers us 194,000 square feet for exhibition by our
subsidiaries (up from 65,000 square feet last year) and much more seating capacity as well. The Qwest’s
doors will open at 7 a.m., the movie will begin at 8:30, and the meeting itself will commence at 9:30.
There will be a short break at noon for food. (Sandwiches will be available at the Qwest’s concession
stands.) That interlude aside, Charlie and I will answer questions until 3:30. We will tell you everything
we know . . . and, at least in my case, more.

An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain
the credential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. As for plane, hotel and car
reservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. They do
a terrific job for us each year, and I thank them for it.

In our usual fashion, we will run vans from the larger hotels to the meeting. Afterwards, the vans
will make trips back to the hotels and to Nebraska Furniture Mart, Borsheim’s and the airport. Even so,
you are likely to find a car useful.

Our exhibition of Berkshire goods and services will blow you away this year. On the floor, for
example, will be a 1,600 square foot Clayton home (featuring Acme brick, Shaw carpet, Johns-Manville
insulation, MiTek fasteners, Carefree awnings, and outfitted with NFM furniture). You'll find it a far cry
from the mobile-home stereotype of a few decades ago.

GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of
them ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a
special shareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 41 of the 49 jurisdictions in
which we operate. Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you
money.

On Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets®
available for your inspection. Stop by the NetJets booth at the Qwest to learn about viewing these planes.
If you buy what we consider an appropriate number of items during the weekend, you may well need your
own plane to take them home.

22
At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72 Street between Dodge and Pacific,
we will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” pricing, which means we will be offering our shareholders a
discount that is customarily given only to employees. We initiated this special pricing at NFM seven years
ago, and sales during the “Weekend” grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $17.3 million in 2003. Every year
has set a new record.

To get the discount, you must make your purchases between Thursday, April 29 and Monday,
May 3 inclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even apply to
the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but
that, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their
cooperation. NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on
Sunday. On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., we are having a special affair for shareholders
only. I’ll be there, eating barbeque and drinking Coke.

Borsheim’s — the largest jewelry store in the country except for Tiffany’s Manhattan store — will
have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday,
April 30. The second, the main gala, will be from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday, May 2. Ask Charlie to
autograph your sales ticket.

Shareholder prices will be available Thursday through Monday, so if you wish to avoid the large
crowds that will assemble on Friday evening and Sunday, come at other times and identify yourself as a
shareholder. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. Borsheim’s operates on a gross margin that is fully
twenty percentage points below that of its major rivals, so the more you buy, the more you save — at least
that’s what my wife and daughter tell me. (Both were impressed early in life by the story of the boy who,
after missing a street car, walked home and proudly announced that he had saved 5¢ by doing so. His
father was irate: “Why didn’t you miss a cab and save 85¢?”)

In the mall outside of Borsheim’s, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the
world’s top bridge experts, available to play with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. Additionally,
Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, will be in the mall, taking on all comers — blindfolded! I’ve
watched, and he doesn’t peek.

Gorat’s — my favorite steakhouse — will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on
Sunday, May 2, and will be serving from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m. Please remember that to come to Gorat’s on
Sunday, you must have a reservation. To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 1 (but not before). If
Sunday is sold out, try Gorat’s on one of the other evenings you will be in town. Flaunt your mastery of
fine dining by ordering, as I do, a rare T-bone with a double order of hash browns.

We will have a special reception on Saturday afternoon from 4:00 to 5:00 for shareholders who
come from outside of North America. Every year our meeting draws many people from around the globe,
and Charlie and I want to be sure we personally meet those who have come so far. Any shareholder who
comes from other than the U.S. or Canada will be given special credentials and instructions for attending
this function.

Charlie and I have a great time at the annual meeting. And you will, too. So join us at the Qwest
for our annual Woodstock for Capitalists.

Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market
rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire’s results
through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculated using
the numbers originally reported.

The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire
were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500
in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P in years when the index showed a
negative retum. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.

BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.

To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:

Our gain in net worth during 2004 was $8.3 billion, which increased the per-share book value of
both our Class A and Class B stock by 10.5%. Over the last 40 years (that is, since present management
took over) book value has grown from $19 to $55,824, a rate of 21.9% compounded annually.*

It’s per-share intrinsic value that counts, however, not book value. Here, the news is good:
Between 1964 and 2004, Berkshire morphed from a struggling northern textile business whose intrinsic
value was less than book into a diversified enterprise worth far more than book. Our 40-year gain in
intrinsic value has therefore somewhat exceeded our 21.9% gain in book. (For an explanation of intrinsic
value and the economic principles that guide Charlie Munger, my partner and Berkshire’s vice-chairman,
and me in running Berkshire, please read our Owner’s Manual, beginning on page 73.)

Despite their shortcomings, yearly calculations of book value are useful at Berkshire as a slightly
understated gauge for measuring the /ong-term rate of increase in our intrinsic value. The calculations are
less relevant, however, than they once were in rating any single year’s performance versus the S&P 500
index (a comparison we display on the facing page). Our equity holdings (including convertible preferreds)
have fallen considerably as a percentage of our net worth, from an average of 114% in the 1980s, for
example, to less than 50% in recent years. Therefore, yearly movements in the stock market now affect a
much smaller portion of our net worth than was once the case, a fact that will normally cause us to
underperform in years when stocks rise substantially and overperform in years when they fall.

However the yearly comparisons work out, Berkshire’s long-term performance versus the S&P
remains all-important. Our shareholders can buy the S&P through an index fund at very low cost. Unless
we achieve gains in per-share intrinsic value in the future that outdo the S&P, Charlie and I will be adding
nothing to what you can accomplish on your own.

Last year, Berkshire’s book-value gain of 10.5% fell short of the index’s 10.9% return. Our
lackluster performance was not due to any stumbles by the CEOs of our operating businesses: As always,
they pulled more than their share of the load. My message to them is simple: Run your business as if it
were the only asset your family will own over the next hundred years. Almost invariably they do just that
and, after taking care of the needs of their business, send excess cash to Omaha for me to deploy.

I didn’t do that job very well last year. My hope was to make several multi-billion dollar
acquisitions that would add new and significant streams of earnings to the many we already have. But I
struck out. Additionally, I found very few attractive securities to buy. Berkshire therefore ended the year
with $43 billion of cash equivalents, not a happy position. Charlie and I will work to translate some of this
hoard into more interesting assets during 2005, though we can’t promise success.

In one respect, 2004 was a remarkable year for the stock market, a fact buried in the maze of
numbers on page 2. If you examine the 35 years since the 1960s ended, you will find that an investor’s
return, including dividends, from owning the S&P has averaged 11.2% annually (well above what we
expect future returns to be). But if you look for years with returns anywhere close to that 11.2% — say,

between 8% and 14% — you will find only one before 2004. In other words, last year’s “normal” return is
anything but.

 

*All figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares, the successor to the only stock that
the company had outstanding before 1996. The B shares have an economic interest equal to 1/30" that of
the A.
Over the 35 years, American business has delivered terrific results. It should therefore have been
easy for investors to earn juicy returns: All they had to do was piggyback Corporate America in a
diversified, low-expense way. An index fund that they never touched would have done the job. Instead
many investors have had experiences ranging from mediocre to disastrous.

There have been three primary causes: first, high costs, usually because investors traded
excessively or spent far too much on investment management; second, portfolio decisions based on tips and
fads rather than on thoughtful, quantified evaluation of businesses; and third, a start-and-stop approach to
the market marked by untimely entries (after an advance has been long underway) and exits (after periods
of stagnation or decline). Investors should remember that excitement and expenses are their enemies. And
if they insist on trying to time their participation in equities, they should try to be fearful when others are
greedy and greedy only when others are fearful.

Sector Results

As managers, Charlie and I want to give our owners the financial information and commentary we
would wish to receive if our roles were reversed. To do this with both clarity and reasonable brevity
becomes more difficult as Berkshire’s scope widens. Some of our businesses have vastly different
economic characteristics from others, which means that our consolidated statements, with their jumble of
figures, make useful analysis almost impossible.

On the following pages, therefore, we will present some balance sheet and earnings figures from
our four major categories of businesses along with commentary about each. We particularly want you to
understand the limited circumstances under which we will use debt, given that we typically shun it. We
will not, however, inundate you with data that has no real value in estimating Berkshire’s intrinsic value.
Doing so would tend to obfuscate the facts that count.

Regulated Utility Businesses

We have an 80.5% (fully diluted) interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which owns a wide
variety of utility operations. The largest of these are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, whose
3.7 million electric customers make it the third largest distributor of electricity in the U.K.; (2)
MidAmerican Energy, which serves 698,000 electric customers, primarily in Iowa; and (3) Kern River and
Northern Natural pipelines, which carry 7.9% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S.

The remaining 19.5% of MidAmerican is owned by three partners of ours: Dave Sokol and Greg
Abel, the brilliant managers of these businesses, and Walter Scott, a long-time friend of mine who
introduced me to the company. Because MidAmerican is subject to the Public Utility Holding Company
Act (“PUHCA”), Berkshire’s voting interest is limited to 9.9%. Voting control rests with Walter.

Our limited voting interest forces us to account for MidAmerican in an abbreviated manner.
Instead of our fully incorporating the company’s assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into Berkshire’s
statements, we make one-line entries only in both our balance sheet and income account. It’s likely,
though, that PUHCA will someday — perhaps soon — be repealed or that accounting rules will change.
Berkshire’s consolidated figures would then incorporate all of MidAmerican, including the substantial debt
it utilizes (though this debt is not now, nor will it ever be, an obligation of Berkshire).

At yearend, $1.478 billion of MidAmerican’s junior debt was payable to Berkshire. This debt has
allowed acquisitions to be financed without our partners needing to increase their already substantial
investments in MidAmerican. By charging 11% interest, Berkshire is compensated fairly for putting up the
funds needed for purchases, while our partners are spared dilution of their equity interests. Because
MidAmerican made no large acquisitions last year, it paid down $100 million of what it owes us.
MidAmerican also owns a significant non-utility business, HomeServices of America, the second
largest real estate broker in the country. Unlike our utility operations, this business is highly cyclical, but
nevertheless one we view enthusiastically. We have an exceptional manager, Ron Peltier, who through
both his acquisition and operational skills is building a brokerage powerhouse.

HomeServices participated in $59.8 billion of transactions in 2004, a gain of $11.2 billion from
2003. About 24% of the increase came from six acquisitions made during the year. Through our 17
brokerage firms — all of which retain their local identities — we employ more than 18,000 brokers in 18
states. HomeServices is almost certain to grow substantially in the next decade as we continue to acquire
leading localized operations.

Last year MidAmerican wrote off a major investment in a zinc recovery project that was initiated
in 1998 and became operational in 2002. Large quantities of zinc are present in the brine produced by our
California geothermal operations, and we believed we could profitably extract the metal. For many
months, it appeared that commercially-viable recoveries were imminent. But in mining, just as in oil
exploration, prospects have a way of “teasing” their developers, and every time one problem was solved,
another popped up. In September, we threw in the towel.

Our failure here illustrates the importance of a guideline — stay with simple propositions — that we
usually apply in investments as well as operations. If only one variable is key to a decision, and the
variable has a 90% chance of going your way, the chance for a successful outcome is obviously 90%. But
if ten independent variables need to break favorably for a successful result, and each has a 90% probability
of success, the likelihood of having a winner is only 35%. In our zinc venture, we solved most of the
problems. But one proved intractable, and that was one too many. Since a chain is no stronger than its
weakest link, it makes sense to look for — if you'll excuse an oxymoron — mono-linked chains.

A breakdown of MidAmerican’s results follows. In 2004, the “other” category includes a $72.2
million profit from sale of an Enron receivable that was thrown in when we purchased Northern Natural
two years earlier. Walter, Dave and I, as natives of Omaha, view this unanticipated gain as war reparations
— partial compensation for the loss our city suffered in 1986 when Ken Lay moved Northern to Houston,
after promising to leave the company here. (For details, see Berkshire’ s 2002 annual report.)

Here are some key figures on MidAmerican’s operations:

Insurance

Since Berkshire purchased National Indemnity (“NICO”) in 1967, property-casualty insurance has
been our core business and the propellant of our growth. Insurance has provided a fountain of funds with
which we’ve acquired the securities and businesses that now give us an ever-widening variety of earnings
streams. So in this section, I will be spending a little time telling you how we got where we are.

The source of our insurance funds is “float,” which is money that doesn’t belong to us but that we
temporarily hold. Most of our float arises because (1) premiums are paid upfront though the service we
provide — insurance protection — is delivered over a period that usually covers a year and; (2) loss events
that occur today do not always result in our immediately paying claims, because it sometimes takes many
years for losses to be reported (asbestos losses would be an example), negotiated and settled. The $20
million of float that came with our 1967 purchase has now increased — both by way of internal growth and
acquisitions — to $46.1 billion.

Float is wonderful — if it doesn’t come at a high price. Its cost is determined by underwriting
results, meaning how the expenses and losses we will ultimately pay compare with the premiums we have
received. When an underwriting profit is achieved — as has been the case at Berkshire in about half of the
38 years we have been in the insurance business — float is better than free. In such years, we are actually
paid for holding other people’s money. For most insurers, however, life has been far more difficult: In
aggregate, the property-casualty industry almost invariably operates at an underwriting loss. When that
loss is large, float becomes expensive, sometimes devastatingly so.

Insurers have generally earned poor returns for a simple reason: They sell a commodity-like
product. Policy forms are standard, and the product is available from many suppliers, some of whom are
mutual companies (“owned” by policyholders rather than stockholders) with profit goals that are limited.
Moreover, most insureds don’t care from whom they buy. Customers by the millions say “I need some
Gillette blades” or “Dll have a Coke” but we wait in vain for “I’d like a National Indemnity policy, please.”
Consequently, price competition in insurance is usually fierce. Think airline seats.

So, you may ask, how do Berkshire’s insurance operations overcome the dismal economics of the
industry and achieve some measure of enduring competitive advantage? We’ve attacked that problem in
several ways. Let’s look first at NICO’s strategy.

When we purchased the company — a specialist in commercial auto and general liability insurance
— it did not appear to have any attributes that would overcome the industry’s chronic troubles. It was not
well-known, had no informational advantage (the company has never had an actuary), was not a low-cost
operator, and sold through general agents, a method many people thought outdated. Nevertheless, for
almost all of the past 38 years, NICO has been a star performer. Indeed, had we not made this acquisition,
Berkshire would be lucky to be worth half of what it is today.

What we’ve had going for us is a managerial mindset that most insurers find impossible to
replicate. Take a look at the facing page. Can you imagine any public company embracing a business
model that would lead to the decline in revenue that we experienced from 1986 through 1999? That
colossal slide, it should be emphasized, did not occur because business was unobtainable. Many billions of
premium dollars were readily available to NICO had we only been willing to cut prices. But we instead
consistently priced to make a profit, not to match our most optimistic competitor. We never left customers
— but they left us.

Most American businesses harbor an “institutional imperative” that rejects extended decreases in
volume. What CEO wants to report to his shareholders that not only did business contract last year but that
it will continue to drop? In insurance, the urge to keep writing business is also intensified because the
consequences of foolishly-priced policies may not become apparent for some time. If an insurer is
optimistic in its reserving, reported earnings will be overstated, and years may pass before true loss costs
are revealed (a form of self-deception that nearly destroyed GEICO in the early 1970s).

*It takes a long time to learn the true profitability of any given year. First, many claims are received after
the end of the year, and we must estimate how many of these there will be and what they will cost. (In
insurance jargon, these claims are termed IBNR — incurred but not reported.) Second, claims often take
years, or even decades, to settle, which means there can be many surprises along the way.

For these reasons, the results in this column simply represent our best estimate at the end of 2004 as to how

we have done in prior years.

Profit margins for the years through 1999 are probably close to correct

because these years are “mature,” in the sense that they have few claims still outstanding. The more recent
the year, the more guesswork is involved. In particular, the results shown for 2003 and 2004 are apt to
change significantly.
Finally, there is a fear factor at work, in that a shrinking business usually leads to layoffs. To
avoid pink slips, employees will rationalize inadequate pricing, telling themselves that poorly-priced
business must be tolerated in order to keep the organization intact and the distribution system happy. If this
course isn’t followed, these employees will argue, the company will not participate in the recovery that
they invariably feel is just around the corner.

To combat employees’ natural tendency to save their own skins, we have always promised
NICO’s workforce that vo one will be fired because of declining volume, however severe the contraction.
(This is not Donald Trump’s sort of place.) NICO is not labor-intensive, and, as the table suggests, can live
with excess overhead. It can’t live, however, with underpriced business and the breakdown in underwriting
discipline that accompanies it. An insurance organization that doesn’t care deeply about underwriting at a
profit shis year is unlikely to care next year either.

Naturally, a business that follows a no-layoff policy must be especially careful to avoid
overstaffing when times are good. Thirty years ago Tom Murphy, then CEO of Cap Cities, drove this point
home to me with a hypothetical tale about an employee who asked his boss for permission to hire an
assistant. The employee assumed that adding $20,000 to the annual payroll would be inconsequential. But
his boss told him the proposal should be evaluated as a $3 million decision, given that an additional person
would probably cost at least that amount over his lifetime, factoring in raises, benefits and other expenses
(more people, more toilet paper). And unless the company fell on very hard times, the employee added
would be unlikely to be dismissed, however marginal his contribution to the business.

It takes real fortitude — embedded deep within a company’s culture — to operate as NICO does.
Anyone examining the table can scan the years from 1986 to 1999 quickly. But living day after day with
dwindling volume — while competitors are boasting of growth and reaping Wall Street’s applause — is an
experience few managers can tolerate. NICO, however, has had four CEOs since its formation in 1940 and
none have bent. (It should be noted that only one of the four graduated from college. Our experience tells
us that extraordinary business ability is largely innate.)

The current managerial star — make that superstar — at NICO is Don Wurster (yes, he’s “the
graduate”), who has been running things since 1989. His slugging percentage is right up there with Barry
Bonds’ because, like Barry, Don will accept a walk rather than swing at a bad pitch. Don has now amassed
$950 million of float at NICO that over time is almost certain to be proved the negative-cost kind. Because
insurance prices are falling, Don’s volume will soon decline very significantly and, as it does, Charlie and I
will applaud him ever more loudly.

Another way to prosper in a commodity-type business is to be the low-cost operator. Among auto
insurers operating on a broad scale, GEICO holds that cherished title. For NICO, as we have seen, an ebb-
and-flow business model makes sense. But a company holding a low-cost advantage must pursue an
unrelenting foot-to-the-floor strategy. And that’s just what we do at GEICO.

A century ago, when autos first appeared, the property-casualty industry operated as a cartel. The
major companies, most of which were based in the Northeast, established “bureau” rates and that was it.
No one cut prices to attract business. Instead, insurers competed for strong, well-regarded agents, a focus
that produced high commissions for agents and high prices for consumers.

In 1922, State Farm was formed by George Mecherle, a farmer from Merna, Illinois, who aimed to
take advantage of the pricing umbrella maintained by the high-cost giants of the industry. State Farm
employed a “captive” agency force, a system keeping its acquisition costs lower than those incurred by the
bureau insurers (whose “independent” agents successfully played off one company against another). With
its low-cost structure, State Farm eventually captured about 25% of the personal lines (auto and
homeowners) business, far outdistancing its once-mighty competitors. Allstate, formed in 1931, put a
similar distribution system into place and soon became the runner-up in personal lines to State Farm.
Capitalism had worked its magic, and these low-cost operations looked unstoppable.
But a man named Leo Goodwin had an idea for an even more efficient auto insurer and, with a
skimpy $200,000, started GEICO in 1936. Goodwin’s plan was to eliminate the agent entirely and to deal
instead directly with the auto owner. Why, he asked himself, should there be any unnecessary and
expensive links in the distribution mechanism when the product, auto insurance, was both mandatory and
costly. Purchasers of business insurance, he reasoned, might well require professional advice, but most
consumers knew what they needed in an auto policy. That was a powerful insight.

Originally, GEICO mailed its low-cost message to a limited audience of government employees.
Later, it widened its horizons and shifted its marketing emphasis to the phone, working inquiries that came
from broadcast and print advertising. And today the Internet is coming on strong.

Between 1936 and 1975, GEICO grew from a standing start to a 4% market share, becoming the
country’s fourth largest auto insurer. During most of this period, the company was superbly managed,
achieving both excellent volume gains and high profits. It looked unstoppable. But after my friend and
hero Lorimer Davidson retired as CEO in 1970, his successors soon made a huge mistake by under-
reserving for losses. This produced faulty cost information, which in turn produced inadequate pricing. By
1976, GEICO was on the brink of failure.

Jack Byme then joined GEICO as CEO and, almost single-handedly, saved the company by heroic
efforts that included major price increases. Though GEICO’s survival required these, policyholders fled
the company, and by 1980 its market share had fallen to 1.8%. Subsequently, the company embarked on
some unwise diversification moves. This shift of emphasis away from its extraordinary core business
stunted GEICO’s growth, and by 1993 its market share had grown only fractionally, to 1.9%. Then Tony
Nicely took charge.

And what a difference that’s made: In 2005 GEICO will probably secure a 6% market share.
Better yet, Tony has matched growth with profitability. Indeed, GEICO delivers all of its constituents
major benefits: In 2004 its customers saved $1 billion or so compared to what they would otherwise have
paid for coverage, its associates earned a $191 million profit-sharing bonus that averaged 24.3% of salary,
and its owner — that’s us — enjoyed excellent financial returns.

There’s more good news. When Jack Byrne was rescuing the company in 1976, New Jersey
refused to grant him the rates he needed to operate profitably. He therefore promptly — and properly —
withdrew from the state. Subsequently, GEICO avoided both New Jersey and Massachusetts, recognizing
them as two jurisdictions in which insurers were destined to struggle.

In 2003, however, New Jersey took a new look at its chronic auto-insurance problems and enacted
legislation that would curb fraud and allow insurers a fair playing field. Even so, one might have expected
the state’s bureaucracy to make change slow and difficult.

But just the opposite occurred. Holly Bakke, the New Jersey insurance commissioner, who would
be a success in amy line of work, was determined to turn the law’s intent into reality. With her staff's
cooperation, GEICO ironed out the details for re-entering the state and was licensed last August. Since
then, we’ve received a response from New Jersey drivers that is multiples of my expectations.

We are now serving 140,000 policyholders — about 4% of the New Jersey market — and saving
them substantial sums (as we do drivers everywhere). Word-of-mouth recommendations within the state
are causing inquiries to pour in. And once we hear from a New Jersey prospect, our closure rate — the
percentage of policies issued to inquiries received — is far higher in the state than it is nationally.

We make no claim, of course, that we can save everyone money. Some companies, using rating
systems that are different from ours, will offer certain classes of drivers a lower rate than we do. But we
believe GEICO offers the lowest price more often than any other national company that serves all segments
of the public. In addition, in most states, including New Jersey, Berkshire shareholders receive an 8%
discount. So gamble fifteen minutes of your time and go to GEICO.com — or call 800-847-7536 — to see
whether you can save big money (which you might want to use, of course, to buy other Berkshire

products).

Reinsurance — insurance sold to other insurers who wish to lay off part of the risks they have
assumed — should not be a commodity product. At bottom, any insurance policy is simply a promise, and
as everyone knows, promises vary enormously in their quality.

At the primary insurance level, nevertheless, just who makes the promise is often of minor
importance. In personal-lines insurance, for example, states levy assessments on solvent companies to pay
the policyholders of companies that go broke. In the business-insurance field, the same arrangement
applies to workers’ compensation policies. “Protected” policies of these types account for about 60% of
the property-casualty industry’s volume. Prudently-run insurers are irritated by the need to subsidize poor
or reckless management elsewhere, but that’s the way it is.

Other forms of business insurance at the primary level involve promises that carry greater risks for
the insured. When Reliance Insurance and Home Insurance were run into the ground, for example, their
promises proved to be worthless. Consequently, many holders of their business policies (other than those
covering workers’ compensation) suffered painful losses.

The solvency risk in primary policies, however, pales in comparison to that lurking in reinsurance
policies. When a reinsurer goes broke, staggering losses almost always strike the primary companies it has
dealt with. This risk is far from minor: GEICO has suffered tens of millions in losses from its careless
selection of reinsurers in the early 1980s.

Were a true mega-catastrophe to occur in the next decade or two — and that’s a real possibility —
some reinsurers would not survive. The largest insured loss to date is the World Trade Center disaster,
which cost the insurance industry an estimated $35 billion. Hurricane Andrew cost insurers about $15.5
billion in 1992 (though that loss would be far higher in today’s dollars). Both events rocked the insurance
and reinsurance world. But a $100 billion event, or even a larger catastrophe, remains a possibility if either
a particularly severe earthquake or hurricane hits just the wrong place. Four significant hurricanes struck
Florida during 2004, causing an aggregate of $25 billion or so in insured losses. Two of these — Charley
and Ivan — could have done at least three times the damage they did had they entered the US. not far from
their actual landing points.

Many insurers regard a $100 billion industry loss as “unthinkable” and won’t even plan for it. But
at Berkshire, we are fully prepared. Our share of the loss would probably be 3% to 5%, and earnings from
our investments and other businesses would comfortably exceed that cost. When “the day after” arrives,
Berkshire’s checks will clear.

Though the hurricanes hit us with a $1.25 billion loss, our reinsurance operations did well last
year. At General Re, Joe Brandon has restored a long-admired culture of underwriting discipline that, for a
time, had lost its way. The excellent results he realized in 2004 on current business, however, were offset
by adverse developments from the years before he took the helm. At NICO’s reinsurance operation, Ajit
Jain continues to successfully underwrite huge risks that no other reinsurer is willing or able to accept.
Ajit’s value to Berkshire is enormous.

Our insurance managers, maximizing the competitive strengths I’ve mentioned in this section,
again delivered first-class underwriting results last year. As a consequence, our float was better than
costless. Here’s the scorecard:

Berkshire’s float increased $1.9 billion in 2004, even though a few insureds opted to commute
(that is, unwind) certain reinsurance contracts. We agree to such commutations only when we believe the
economics are favorable to us (after giving due weight to what we might earn in the future on the money
we are returning).

To summarize, last year we were paid more than $1.5 billion to hold an average of about $45.2
billion. In 2005 pricing will be less attractive than it has been. Nevertheless, absent a mega-catastrophe,
we have a decent chance of achieving no-cost float again this year.

Finance and Finance Products

Last year in this section we discussed a potpourri of activities. In this report, we’ll skip over
several that are now of lesser importance: Berkadia is down to tag ends; Value Capital has added other
investors, negating our expectation that we would need to consolidate its financials into ours; and the
trading operation that I run continues to shrink.

e Both of Berkshire’s leasing operations rebounded last year. At CORT (office furniture), earnings
remain inadequate, but are trending upward. XTRA disposed of its container and intermodal
businesses in order to concentrate on trailer leasing, long its strong suit. Overhead has been
reduced, asset utilization is up and decent profits are now being achieved under Bill Franz, the
company’s new CEO.

e The wind-down of Gen Re Securities continues. We decided to exit this derivative operation three
years ago, but getting out is easier said than done. Though derivative instruments are purported to
be highly liquid — and though we have had the benefit of a benign market while liquidating ours —
we still had 2,890 contracts outstanding at yearend, down from 23,218 at the peak. Like Hell,
derivative trading is easy to enter but difficult to leave. (Other similarities come to mind as well.)

Gen Re’s derivative contracts have always been required to be marked to market, and I believe the
company’s management conscientiously tried to make realistic “marks.” The market prices of
derivatives, however, can be very fuzzy in a world in which settlement of a transaction is
sometimes decades away and often involves multiple variables as well. In the interim the marks
influence the managerial and trading bonuses that are paid annually. It’s small wonder that
phantom profits are often recorded.

Investors should understand that in all types of financial institutions, rapid growth sometimes
masks major underlying problems (and occasionally fraud). The real test of the earning power of
a derivatives operation is what it achieves after operating for an extended period in a no-growth
mode. You only learn who has been swimming naked when the tide goes out.

e After 40 years, we’ve finally generated a little synergy at Berkshire: Clayton Homes is doing well
and that’s in part due to its association with Berkshire. The manufactured home industry

11
continues to reside in the intensive care unit of Corporate America, having sold less than 135,000
new homes last year, about the same as in 2003. Volume in these years was the lowest since
1962, and it was also only about 40% of annual sales during the years 1995-99. That era,
characterized by irresponsible financing and naive funders, was a fool’s paradise for the industry.

Because one major lender after another has fled the field, financing continues to bedevil
manufacturers, retailers and purchasers of manufactured homes. Here Berkshire’s support has
proven valuable to Clayton. We stand ready to fund whatever makes sense, and last year
Clayton’s management found much that qualified.

As we explained in our 2003 report, we believe in using borrowed money to support profitable,
interest-bearing receivables. At the beginning of last year, we had borrowed $2 billion to relend to
Clayton (at a one percentage-point markup) and by January 2005 the total was $7.35 billion. Most
of the dollars added were borrowed by us on January 4, 2005, to finance a seasoned portfolio that
Clayton purchased on December 30, 2004 from a bank exiting the business.

We now have two additional portfolio purchases in the works, totaling about $1.6 billion, but it’s
quite unlikely that we will secure others of any significance. Therefore, Clayton’s receivables (in
which originations will roughly offset payoffs) will probably hover around $9 billion for some
time and should deliver steady earnings. This pattern will be far different from that of the past, in
which Clayton, like all major players in its industry, “securitized” its receivables, causing earnings
to be front-ended. In the last two years, the securitization market has dried up. The limited funds
available today come only at higher cost and with harsh terms. Had Clayton remained
independent in this period, it would have had mediocre earnings as it struggled with financing.

In April, Clayton completed the acquisition of Oakwood Homes and is now the industry’s largest
producer and retailer of manufactured homes. We love putting more assets in the hands of Kevin
Clayton, the company’s CEO. He is a prototype Berkshire manager. Today, Clayton has 11,837
employees, up from 7,136 when we purchased it, and Charlie and I are pleased that Berkshire has
been useful in facilitating this growth.

For simplicity’s sake, we include all of Clayton’s earnings in this sector, though a sizable portion
of these are derived from areas other than consumer finance.

This eclectic group, which sells products ranging from Dilly Bars to fractional interests in Boeing
737s, eared a very respectable 21.7% on average tangible net worth last year, compared to 20.7% in 2003.
It’s noteworthy that these operations used only minor financial leverage in achieving these returns. Clearly,
we own some very good businesses. We purchased many of them, however, at substantial premiums to net
worth — a matter that is reflected in the goodwill item shown on the balance sheet — and that fact reduces
the earnings on our average carrying value to 9.9%.

e = In the building-products sector and at Shaw, we’ve experienced staggering cost increases for both raw-
materials and energy. By December, for example, steel costs at MiTek (whose primary business is
connectors for roof trusses) were running 100% over a year earlier. And MiTek uses 665 million
pounds of steel every year. Nevertheless, the company continues to be an outstanding performer.

13
Since we purchased MiTek in 2001, Gene Toombs, its CEO, has made some brilliant “bolt-on”
acquisitions and is on his way to creating a mini-Berkshire.

Shaw fielded a barrage of price increases in its main fiber materials during the year, a hit that added
more than $300 million to its costs. (When you walk on carpet you are, in effect, stepping on
processed oil.) Though we followed these hikes in costs with price increases of our own, there was an
inevitable lag. Therefore, margins narrowed as the year progressed and remain under pressure today.
Despite these roadblocks, Shaw, led by Bob Shaw and Julian Saul, earned an outstanding 25.6% on
tangible equity in 2004. The company is a powerhouse and has a bright future.

In apparel, Fruit of the Loom increased unit sales by 10 million dozen, or 14%, with shipments of
intimate apparel for women and girls growing by 31%. Charlie, who is far more knowledgeable than I
am on this subject, assures me that women are not wearing more underwear. With this expert input, I
can only conclude that our market share in the women’s category must be growing rapidly. Thanks to
John Holland, Fruit is on the move.

A smaller operation, Garan, also had an excellent year. Led by Seymour Lichtenstein and Jerry
Kamiel, this company manufactures the popular Garanimals line for children. Next time you are in a
Wal-Mart, check out this imaginative product.

Among our retailers, Ben Bridge (jewelry) and R. C. Willey (home furnishings) were particular
standouts last year.

At Ben Bridge same-store sales grew 11.4%, the best gain among the publicly-held jewelers whose
reports I have seen. Additionally, the company’s profit margin widened. Last year was not a fluke:
During the past decade, the same-store sales gains of the company have averaged 8.8%.

Ed and Jon Bridge are fourth-generation managers and run the business exactly as if it were their own
— which it is in every respect except for Berkshire’s name on the stock certificates. The Bridges have
expanded successfully by securing the right locations and, more importantly, by staffing these stores
with enthusiastic and knowledgeable associates. We will move into Minneapolis-St. Paul this year.

At Utah-based R. C. Willey, the gains from expansion have been even more dramatic, with 41.9% of
2004 sales coming from out-of-state stores that didn’t exist before 1999. The company also improved
its profit margin in 2004, propelled by its two new stores in Las Vegas.

I would like to tell you that these stores were my idea. In truth, I thought they were mistakes. I knew,
of course, how brilliantly Bill Child had run the R. C. Willey operation in Utah, where its market share
had long been huge. But I felt our closed-on-Sunday policy would prove disastrous away from home.
Even our first out-of-state store in Boise, which was highly successful, left me unconvinced. I kept
asking whether Las Vegas residents, conditioned to seven-day-a-week retailers, would adjust to us.
Our first Las Vegas store, opened in 2001, answered this question in a resounding manner,
immediately becoming our number one unit.

Bill and Scott Hymas, his successor as CEO, then proposed a second Las Vegas store, only about 20
minutes away. I felt this expansion would cannibalize the first unit, adding significant costs but only
modest sales. The result? Each store is now doing about 26% more volume than any other store in the
chain and is consistently showing large year-over-year gains.

R. C. Willey will soon open in Reno. Before making this commitment, Bill and Scott again asked for
my advice. Initially, | was pretty puffed up about the fact that they were consulting me. But then it
dawned on me that the opinion of someone who is a/ways wrong has its own special utility to decision-
makers.

14
Earnings improved in flight services. At FlightSafety, the world’s leader in pilot training, profits rose
as corporate aviation rebounded and our business with regional airlines increased. We now operate
283 simulators with an original cost of $1.2 billion. Pilots are trained one at a time on this expensive
equipment. This means that as much as $3.50 of capital investment is required to produce $1 of annual
revenue. With this level of capital intensity, FlightSafety requires very high operating margins in order
to obtain reasonable returns on capital, which means that utilization rates are all-important. Last year,
FlightSafety’s return on tangible equity improved to 15.1% from 8.4% in 2003.

In another 2004 event, Al Ueltschi, who founded FlightSafety in 1951 with $10,000, turned over the
CEO position to Bruce Whitman, a 43-year veteran at the company. (But Al’s not going anywhere; I
won’t let him.) Bruce shares Al’s conviction that flying an aircraft is a privilege to be extended only to
people who regularly receive the highest quality of training and are undeniably competent. A few
years ago, Charlie was asked to intervene with Al on behalf of a tycoon friend whom FlightSafety had
flunked. Al’s reply to Charlie: “Tell your pal he belongs in the back of the plane, not the cockpit.”

FlightSafety’s number one customer is NetJets, our aircraft fractional-ownership subsidiary. Its 2,100
pilots spend an average of 18 days a year in training. Additionally, these pilots fly only one aircraft
type whereas many flight operations juggle pilots among several types. NetJets’ high standards on
both fronts are two of the reasons I signed up with the company years before Berkshire bought it.

Fully as important in my decisions to both use and buy NetJets, however, was the fact that the
company was managed by Rich Santulli, the creator of the fractional-ownership industry and a fanatic
about safety and service. I viewed the selection of a flight provider as akin to picking a brain surgeon:
you simply want the best. (Let someone else experiment with the low bidder.)

Last year NetJets again gained about 70% of the net new business (measured by dollar value) going to
the four companies that dominate the industry. A portion of our growth came from the 25-hour card
offered by Marquis Jet Partners. Marquis is not owned by NetJets, but is instead a customer that
repackages the purchases it makes from us into smaller packages that it sells through its card. Marquis
deals exclusively with NetJets, utilizing the power of our reputation in its marketing.

Our U.S. contracts, including Marquis customers, grew from 3,877 to 4,967 in 2004 (versus
approximately 1,200 contracts when Berkshire bought NetJets in 1998). Some clients (including me)
enter into multiple contracts because they wish to use more than one type of aircraft, selecting for any
given trip whichever type best fits the mission at hand.

NetJets earned a modest amount in the U.S. last year. But what we earned domestically was largely
offset by losses in Europe. We are now, however, generating real momentum abroad. Contracts
(including 25-hour cards that we ourselves market in Europe) increased from 364 to 693 during the
year. We will again have a very significant European loss in 2005, but domestic earnings will likely
put us in the black overall.

Europe has been expensive for NetJets — far more expensive than I anticipated — but it is essential to
building a flight operation that will forever be in a class by itself. Our U.S. owners already want a
quality service wherever they travel and their wish for flight hours abroad is certain to grow
dramatically in the decades ahead. Last year, U.S. owners made 2,003 flights in Europe, up 22% from
the previous year and 137% from 2000. Just as important, our European owners made 1,067 flights in
the U.S., up 65% from 2003 and 239% from 2000.

*This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP “cost” differs in a few cases
because of write-ups or write-downs that have been required.

Some people may look at this table and view it as a list of stocks to be bought and sold based upon
chart patterns, brokers’ opinions, or estimates of near-term earnings. Charlie and I ignore such distractions
and instead view our holdings as fractional ownerships in businesses. This is an important distinction.
Indeed, this thinking has been the cornerstone of my investment behavior since I was 19. At that time I
read Ben Graham’s The Intelligent Investor, and the scales fell from my eyes. (Previously, I had been
entranced by the stock market, but didn’t have a clue about how to invest.)

Let’s look at how the businesses of our “Big Four” — American Express, Coca-Cola, Gillette and
Wells Fargo — have fared since we bought into these companies. As the table shows, we invested $3.83
billion in the four, by way of multiple transactions between May 1988 and October 2003. On a composite
basis, our dollar-weighted purchase date is July 1992. By yearend 2004, therefore, we had held these
“business interests,” on a weighted basis, about 12% years.

In 2004, Berkshire’s share of the group’s earnings amounted to $1.2 billion. These earnings might
legitimately be considered “normal.” True, they were swelled because Gillette and Wells Fargo omitted
option costs in their presentation of earnings; but on the other hand they were reduced because Coke had a
non-recurring write-off.

Our share of the earnings of these four companies has grown almost every year, and now amounts
to about 31.3% of our cost. Their cash distributions to us have also grown consistently, totaling $434
million in 2004, or about 11.3% of cost. All in all, the Big Four have delivered us a satisfactory, though far
from spectacular, business result.

That’s true as well of our experience in the market with the group. Since our original purchases,
valuation gains have somewhat exceeded earnings growth because price/earnings ratios have increased. On
a year-to-year basis, however, the business and market performances have often diverged, sometimes to an
extraordinary degree. During The Great Bubble, market-value gains far outstripped the performance of the
businesses. In the aftermath of the Bubble, the reverse was true.

16
Clearly, Berkshire’s results would have been far better if I had caught this swing of the pendulum.
That may seem easy to do when one looks through an always-clean, rear-view mirror. Unfortunately,
however, it’s the windshield through which investors must peer, and that glass is invariably fogged. Our
huge positions add to the difficulty of our nimbly dancing in and out of holdings as valuations swing.

Nevertheless, I can properly be criticized for merely clucking about nose-bleed valuations during
the Bubble rather than acting on my views. Though I said at the time that certain of the stocks we held
were priced ahead of themselves, I underestimated just how severe the overvaluation was. I talked when I
should have walked.

What Charlie and I would like is a little action now. We don’t enjoy sitting on $43 billion of cash
equivalents that are earning paltry returns. Instead, we yearn to buy more fractional interests similar to
those we now own or — better still — more large businesses outright. We will do either, however, only when
purchases can be made at prices that offer us the prospect of a reasonable return on our investment.

We’ve repeatedly emphasized that the “realized” gains that we report quarterly or annually are
meaningless for analytical purposes. We have a huge amount of unrealized gains on our books, and our
thinking about when, and if, to cash them depends not at all on a desire to report earnings at one specific
time or another. A further complication in our reported gains occurs because GAAP requires that foreign
exchange contracts be marked to market, a stipulation that causes unrealized gains or losses in these
holdings to flow through our published earnings as if we had sold our positions.

Despite the problems enumerated, you may be interested in a breakdown of the gains we reported
in 2003 and 2004. The data reflect actual sales except in the case of currency gains, which are a
combination of sales and marks to market.

The junk bond profits include a foreign exchange component. When we bought these bonds in
2001 and 2002, we focused first, of course, on the credit quality of the issuers, all of which were American
corporations. Some of these companies, however, had issued bonds denominated in foreign currencies.
Because of our views on the dollar, we favored these for purchase when they were available.

As an example, we bought €254 million of Level 3 bonds (10 *4% of 2008) in 2001 at 51.7% of
par, and sold these at 85% of par in December 2004. This issue was traded in Euros that cost us 88¢ at the
time of purchase but that brought $1.29 when we sold. Thus, of our $163 million overall gain, about $85
million came from the market’s revised opinion about Level 3’s credit quality, with the remaining $78
million resulting from the appreciation of the Euro. (In addition, we received cash interest during our
holding period that amounted to about 25% annually on our dollar cost.)

The media continue to report that “Buffett buys” this or that stock. Statements like these are
almost always based on filings Berkshire makes with the SEC and are therefore wrong. As I’ve said
before, the stories should say “Berkshire buys.”

Even then, it is typically not I who make the buying decisions. Lou Simpson manages about $214
billion of equities that are held by GEICO, and it is his transactions that Berkshire is usually reporting.
Customarily his purchases are in the $200-$300 million range and are in companies that are smaller than
the ones I focus on. Take a look at the facing page to see why Lou is a cinch to be inducted into the
investment Hall of Fame.

You may be surprised to learn that Lou does not necessarily inform me about what he is doing.
When Charlie and I assign responsibility, we truly hand over the baton — and we give it to Lou just as we
do to our operating managers. Therefore, I typically learn of Lou’s transactions about ten days after the
end of each month. Sometimes, it should be added, I silently disagree with his decisions. But he’s usually right

Foreign Currencies

Berkshire owned about $21.4 billion of foreign exchange contracts at yearend, spread among 12
currencies. As I mentioned last year, holdings of this kind are a decided change for us. Before March
2002, neither Berkshire nor I had ever traded in currencies. But the evidence grows that our trade policies
will put unremitting pressure on the dollar for many years to come — so since 2002 we’ve heeded that
warning in setting our investment course. (As W.C. Fields once said when asked for a handout: “Sorry,
son, all my money’s tied up in currency.”)

Be clear on one point: In no way does our thinking about currencies rest on doubts about America.
We live in an extraordinarily rich country, the product of a system that values market economics, the rule
of law and equality of opportunity. Our economy is far and away the strongest in the world and will
continue to be. We are lucky to live here.

But as I argued in a November 10, 2003 article in Fortune, (available at berkshirehathaway.com),
our country’s trade practices are weighing down the dollar. The decline in its value has already been
substantial, but is nevertheless likely to continue. Without policy changes, currency markets could even
become disorderly and generate spillover effects, both political and financial. No one knows whether these
problems will materialize. But such a scenario is a far-from-remote possibility that policymakers should be
considering vow. Their bent, however, is to lean toward not-so-benign neglect: A 318-page Congressional
study of the consequences of unremitting trade deficits was published in November 2000 and has been
gathering dust ever since. The study was ordered after the deficit hit a then-alarming $263 billion in 1999;
by last year it had risen to $618 billion.

Charlie and I, it should be emphasized, believe that true trade — that is, the exchange of goods and
services with other countries — is enormously beneficial for both us and them. Last year we had $1.15
trillion of such honest-to-God trade and the more of this, the better. But, as noted, our country also
purchased an additional $618 billion in goods and services from the rest of the world that was
unreciprocated. That is a staggering figure and one that has important consequences.

The balancing item to this one-way pseudo-trade — in economics there is always an offset — is a
transfer of wealth from the U.S. to the rest of the world. The transfer may materialize in the form of IOUs
our private or governmental institutions give to foreigners, or by way of their assuming ownership of our
assets, such as stocks and real estate. In either case, Americans end up owning a reduced portion of our
country while non-Americans own a greater part. This force-feeding of American wealth to the rest of the
world is now proceeding at the rate of $1.8 billion daily, an increase of 20% since I wrote you last year.
Consequently, other countries and their citizens now own a net of about $3 trillion of the U.S. A decade
ago their net ownership was negligible.

The mention of trillions numbs most brains. A further source of confusion is that the current
account deficit (the sum of three items, the most important by far being the trade deficit) and our national
budget deficit are often lumped as “twins.” They are anything but. They have different causes and
different consequences.

19
A budget deficit in no way reduces the portion of the national pie that goes to Americans. As long
as other countries and their citizens have no net ownership of the U.S., 100% of our country’s output
belongs to our citizens under any budget scenario, even one involving a huge deficit.

As a rich “family” awash in goods, Americans will argue through their legislators as to how
government should redistribute the national output — that is who pays taxes and who receives governmental
benefits. If “entitlement” promises from an earlier day have to be reexamined, “family members” will
angrily debate among themselves as to who feels the pain. Maybe taxes will go up; maybe promises will
be modified; maybe more internal debt will be issued. But when the fight is finished, a// of the family’s
huge pie remains available for its members, however it is divided. No slice must be sent abroad.

Large and persisting current account deficits produce an entirely different result. As time passes,
and as claims against us grow, we own less and less of what we produce. In effect, the rest of the world
enjoys an ever-growing royalty on American output. Here, we are like a family that consistently
overspends its income. As time passes, the family finds that it is working more and more for the “finance
company” and less for itself.

Should we continue to run current account deficits comparable to those now prevailing, the net
ownership of the U.S. by other countries and their citizens a decade from now will amount to roughly $11
trillion. And, if foreign investors were to earn only 5% on that net holding, we would need to send a net of
$.55 trillion of goods and services abroad every year merely to service the U.S. investments then held by
foreigners. At that date, a decade out, our GDP would probably total about $18 trillion (assuming low
inflation, which is far from a sure thing). Therefore, our U.S. “family” would then be delivering 3% of its
annual output to the rest of the world simply as tribute for the overindulgences of the past. In this case,
unlike that involving budget deficits, the sons would truly pay for the sins of their fathers.

This annual royalty paid the world — which would not disappear unless the U.S. massively
underconsumed and began to run consistent and large trade surpluses — would undoubtedly produce
significant political unrest in the U.S. Americans would still be living very well, indeed better than now
because of the growth in our economy. But they would chafe at the idea of perpetually paying tribute to
their creditors and owners abroad. A country that is now aspiring to an “Ownership Society” will not find
happiness in — and I’Il use hyperbole here for emphasis — a “Sharecropper’s Society.” But that’s precisely
where our trade policies, supported by Republicans and Democrats alike, are taking us.

Many prominent U.S. financial figures, both in and out of government, have stated that our
current-account deficits cannot persist. For instance, the minutes of the Federal Reserve Open Market
Committee of June 29-30, 2004 say: “The staff noted that outsized external deficits could not be sustained
indefinitely.” But, despite the constant handwringing by luminaries, they offer no substantive suggestions
to tame the burgeoning imbalance.

In the article I wrote for Fortune 16 months ago, I warned that “a gently declining dollar would
not provide the answer.” And so far it hasn’t. Yet policymakers continue to hope for a “soft landing,”
meanwhile counseling other countries to stimulate (read “inflate”) their economies and Americans to save
more. In my view these admonitions miss the mark: There are deep-rooted structural problems that will
cause America to continue to run a huge current-account deficit unless trade policies either change
materially or the dollar declines by a degree that could prove unsettling to financial markets.

Proponents of the trade status quo are fond of quoting Adam Smith: “What is prudence in the
conduct of every family can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom. Ifa foreign country can supply us
with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the
produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage.”

I agree. Note, however, that Mr. Smith’s statement refers to trade of product for product, not of

wealth for product as our country is doing to the tune of $.6 trillion annually. Moreover, I am sure that he
would never have suggested that “prudence” consisted of his “family” selling off part of its farm every day

20
in order to finance its overconsumption. Yet that is just what the “great kingdom” called the United States
is doing.

If the U.S. was running a $.6 trillion current-account surplus, commentators worldwide would
violently condemn our policy, viewing it as an extreme form of “mercantilism” — a long-discredited
economic strategy under which countries fostered exports, discouraged imports, and piled up treasure. I
would condemn such a policy as well. But, in effect if not in intent, the rest of the world is practicing
mercantilism in respect to the U.S., an act made possible by our vast store of assets and our pristine credit
history. Indeed, the world would never let any other country use a credit card denominated in its own
currency to the insatiable extent we are employing ours. Presently, most foreign investors are sanguine:
they may view us as spending junkies, but they know we are rich junkies as well.

Our spendthrift behavior won’t, however, be tolerated indefinitely. And though it’s impossible to
forecast just when and how the trade problem will be resolved, it’s improbable that the resolution will
foster an increase in the value of our currency relative to that of our trading partners.

We hope the U.S. adopts policies that will quickly and substantially reduce the current-account
deficit. True, a prompt solution would likely cause Berkshire to record losses on its foreign-exchange
contracts. But Berkshire’s resources remain heavily concentrated in dollar-based assets, and both a strong
dollar and a low-inflation environment are very much in our interest.

If you wish to keep abreast of trade and currency matters, read The Financial Times. This
London-based paper has long been the leading source for daily international financial news and now has an
excellent American edition. Both its reporting and commentary on trade are first-class.

2K 2K ok oe ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok

And, again, our usual caveat: macro-economics is a tough game in which few people, Charlie and
I included, have demonstrated skill. We may well turn out to be wrong in our currency judgments.
(Indeed, the fact that so many pundits now predict weakness for the dollar makes us uneasy.) If so, our
mistake will be very public. The irony is that if we chose the opposite course, leaving all of Berkshire’s
assets in dollars even as they declined significantly in value, no one would notice our mistake.

John Maynard Keynes said in his masterful The General Theory: “Worldly wisdom teaches that it
is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.” (Or, to put it in less elegant
terms, lemmings as a class may be derided but never does an individual lemming get criticized.) From a
reputational standpoint, Charlie and I run a clear risk with our foreign-exchange commitment. But we
believe in managing Berkshire as if we owned 100% of it ourselves. And, were that the case, we would not
be following a dollar-only policy.

Miscellaneous

e = Last year I told you about a group of University of Tennessee finance students who played a key
role in our $1.7 billion acquisition of Clayton Homes. Earlier, they had been brought to Omaha by
their professor, Al Auxier — he brings a class every year — to tour Nebraska Furniture Mart and
Borsheim’s, eat at Gorat’s and have a Q&A session with me at Kiewit Plaza. These visitors, like
those who come for our annual meeting, leave impressed by both the city and its friendly
residents.

Other colleges and universities have now come calling. This school year we will have visiting
classes, ranging in size from 30 to 100 students, from Chicago, Dartmouth (Tuck), Delaware State,
Florida State, Indiana, Iowa, Iowa State, Maryland, Nebraska, Northwest Nazarene, Pennsylvania
(Wharton), Stanford, Tennessee, Texas, Texas A&M, Toronto (Rotman), Union and Utah. Most
of the students are MBA candidates, and I’ve been impressed by their quality. They are keenly
interested in business and investments, but their questions indicate that they also have more on
their minds than simply making money. I always feel good after meeting them.

21
At our sessions, I tell the newcomers the story of the Tennessee group and its spotting of Clayton
Homes. I do this in the spirit of the farmer who enters his hen house with an ostrich egg and
admonishes the flock: “I don’t like to complain, girls, but this is just a small sample of what the
competition is doing.” To date, our new scouts have not brought us deals. But their mission in
life has been made clear to them.

You should be aware of an accounting rule that mildly distorts our financial statements in a pain-
today, gain-tomorrow manner. Berkshire purchases life insurance policies from individuals and
corporations who would otherwise surrender them for cash. As the new holder of the policies, we
pay any premiums that become due and ultimately — when the original holder dies — collect the
face value of the policies.

The original policyholder is usually in good health when we purchase the policy. Still, the price
we pay for it is always well above its cash surrender value (“CSV”). Sometimes the original
policyholder has borrowed against the CSV to make premium payments. In that case, the
remaining CSV will be tiny and our purchase price will be a large multiple of what the original
policyholder would have received, had he cashed out by surrendering it.

Under accounting rules, we must immediately charge as a realized capital loss the excess over
CSV that we pay upon purchasing the policy. We also must make additional charges each year for
the amount by which the premium we pay to keep the policy in force exceeds the increase in CSV.
But obviously, we don’t think these bookkeeping charges represent economic losses. If we did,
we wouldn’t buy the policies.

During 2004, we recorded net “losses” from the purchase of policies (and from the premium
payments required to maintain them) totaling $207 million, which was charged against realized
investment gains in our earnings statement (included in “other” in the table on page 17). When
the proceeds from these policies are received in the future, we will record as realized investment
gain the excess over the then-CSV.

Two post-bubble governance reforms have been particularly useful at Berkshire, and I fault myself
for not putting them in place many years ago. The first involves regular meetings of directors
without the CEO present. I’ve sat on 19 boards, and on many occasions this process would have
led to dubious plans being examined more thoroughly. In a few cases, CEO changes that were
needed would also have been made more promptly. There is no downside to this process, and
there are many possible benefits.

The second reform concerms the “whistleblower line,” an arrangement through which employees
can send information to me and the board’s audit committee without fear of reprisal. Berkshire’s
extreme decentralization makes this system particularly valuable both to me and the committee.
(In a sprawling “city” of 180,000 — Berkshire’s current employee count — not every sparrow that
falls will be noticed at headquarters.) Most of the complaints we have received are of “the guy
next to me has bad breath” variety, but on occasion I have learned of important problems at our
subsidiaries that I otherwise would have missed. The issues raised are usually not of a type
discoverable by audit, but relate instead to personnel and business practices. Berkshire would be
more valuable today if I had put in a whistleblower line decades ago.

Charlie and I love the idea of shareholders thinking and behaving like owners. Sometimes that
requires them to be pro-active. And in this arena large institutional owners should lead the way.

So far, however, the moves made by institutions have been less than awe-inspiring. Usually,
they’ve focused on minutiae and ignored the three questions that truly count. First, does the
company have the right CEO? Second, is he/she overreaching in terms of compensation? Third,
are proposed acquisitions more likely to create or destroy per-share value?

22
On such questions, the interests of the CEO may well differ from those of the shareholders.
Directors, moreover, sometimes lack the knowledge or gumption to overrule the CEO. Therefore,
it’s vital that large owners focus on these three questions and speak up when necessary.

Instead many simply follow a “checklist” approach to the issue du jour. Last year I was on the
receiving end of a judgment reached in that manner. Several institutional shareholders and their
advisors decided I lacked “independence” in my role as a director of Coca-Cola. One group
wanted me removed from the board and another simply wanted me booted from the audit
committee.

My first impulse was to secretly fund the group behind the second idea. Why anyone would wish
to be on an audit committee is beyond me. But since directors must be assigned to one committee
or another, and since no CEO wants me on his compensation committee, it’s often been my lot to
get an audit committee assignment. As it turned out, the institutions that opposed me failed and I
was re-elected to the audit job. (I fought off the urge to ask for a recount.)

Some institutions questioned my “independence” because, among other things, McLane and Dairy
Queen buy lots of Coke products. (Do they want us to favor Pepsi?) But independence is defined
in Webster’s as “not subject to control by others.” I’m puzzled how anyone could conclude that
our Coke purchases would “control” my decision-making when the counterweight is the well-
being of $8 billion of Coke stock held by Berkshire. Assuming I’m even marginally rational,
elementary arithmetic should make it clear that my heart and mind belong to the owners of Coke,
not to its management.

I can’t resist mentioning that Jesus understood the calibration of independence far more clearly
than do the protesting institutions. In Matthew 6:21 He observed: “For where your treasure is,
there will your heart be also.” Even to an institutional investor, $8 billion should qualify as
“treasure” that dwarfs any profits Berkshire might earn on its routine transactions with Coke.

Measured by the biblical standard, the Berkshire board is a model: (a) every director is a member
of a family owning at least $4 million of stock; (b) none of these shares were acquired from
Berkshire via options or grants; (c) mo directors receive committee, consulting or board fees from
the company that are more than a tiny portion of their annual income; and (d) although we have a
standard corporate indemnity arrangement, we carry no liability insurance for directors.

At Berkshire, board members travel the same road as shareholders.

2K 2K ok ok ok ok ok Ok ok ok ok Ok

Charlie and I have seen much behavior confirming the Bible’s “treasure” point. In our view,
based on our considerable boardroom experience, the /east independent directors are likely to be
those who receive an important fraction of their annual income from the fees they receive for
board service (and who hope as well to be recommended for election to other boards and thereby
to boost their income further). Yet these are the very board members most often classed as
“independent.”

Most directors of this type are decent people and do a first-class job. But they wouldn’t be human
if they weren’t tempted to thwart actions that would threaten their livelihood. Some may go on to
succumb to such temptations.

Let’s look at an example based upon circumstantial evidence. I have first-hand knowledge of a
recent acquisition proposal (not from Berkshire) that was favored by management, blessed by the
company’s investment banker and slated to go forward at a price above the level at which the
stock had sold for some years (or now sells for). In addition, a number of directors favored the
transaction and wanted it proposed to shareholders.

23
Several of their brethren, however, each of whom received board and committee fees totaling
about $100,000 annually, scuttled the proposal, which meant that shareholders never learned of
this multi-billion offer. Non-management directors owned little stock except for shares they had
received from the company. Their open-market purchases in recent years had meanwhile been
nominal, even though the stock had sold far below the acquisition price proposed. In other words,
these directors didn’t want the shareholders to be offered X even though they had consistently
declined the opportunity to buy stock for their own account at a fraction of X.

I don’t know which directors opposed letting shareholders see the offer. But I do know that
$100,000 is an important portion of the annual income of some of those deemed “independent,”
clearly meeting the Matthew 6:21 definition of “treasure.” Ifthe deal had gone through, these fees
would have ended.

Neither the shareholders nor I will ever know what motivated the dissenters. Indeed they
themselves will not likely know, given that self-interest inevitably blurs introspection. We do
know one thing, though: At the same meeting at which the deal was rejected, the board voted itself
a significant increase in directors’ fees.

While we are on the subject of self-interest, let’s turn again to the most important accounting
mechanism still available to CEOs who wish to overstate earnings: the non-expensing of stock
options. The accomplices in perpetuating this absurdity have been many members of Congress
who have defied the arguments put forth by all Big Four auditors, all members of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board and virtually all investment professionals.

I’m enclosing an op-ed piece I wrote for The Washington Post describing a truly breathtaking bill
that was passed 312-111 by the House last summer. Thanks to Senator Richard Shelby, the Senate
didn’t ratify the House’s foolishness. And, to his great credit, Bill Donaldson, the investor-
minded Chairman of the SEC, has stood firm against massive political pressure, generated by the
check-waving CEOs who first muscled Congress in 1993 about the issue of option accounting and
then repeated the tactic last year.

Because the attempts to obfuscate the stock-option issue continue, it’s worth pointing out that no
one — neither the FASB, nor investors generally, nor I — are talking about restricting the use of
options in any way. Indeed, my successor at Berkshire may well receive much of his pay via
options, albeit logically-structured ones in respect to 1) an appropriate strike price, 2) an escalation
in price that reflects the retention of earnings, and 3) a ban on his quickly disposing of any shares
purchased through options. We cheer arrangements that motivate managers, whether these be
cash bonuses or options. And if a company is truly receiving value for the options it issues, we
see no reason why recording their cost should cut down on their use.

The simple fact is that certain CEOs know their own compensation would be far more rationally
determined if options were expensed. They also suspect that their stock would sell at a lower price
if realistic accounting were employed, meaning that they would reap less in the market when they
unloaded their personal holdings. To these CEOs such unpleasant prospects are a fate to be fought
with all the resources they have at hand — even though the funds they use in that fight normally
don’t belong to them, but are instead put up by their shareholders.

Option-expensing is scheduled to become mandatory on June 15". You can therefore expect

intensified efforts to stall or emasculate this rule between now and then. Let your Congressman
and Senators know what you think on this issue.

The Annual Meeting

There are two changes this year concerning the annual meeting. First, we have scheduled the
meeting for the last Saturday in April (the 30"), rather than the usual first Saturday in May. This year
Mother’s Day falls on May 8, and it would be unfair to ask the employees of Borsheim’s and Gorat’s to
take care of us at that special time — so we’ve moved everything up a week. Next year we’ll return to our
regular timing, holding the meeting on May 6, 2006.

Additionally, we are changing the sequence of events on meeting day, April 30. Just as always,
the doors will open at the Qwest Center at 7 a.m. and the movie will be shown at 8:30. At 9:30, however,
we will go directly to the question and answer period, which (allowing for lunch at the Qwest’s stands) will
last until 3:00. Then, after a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:15.

We have made this change because a number of shareholders complained last year about the time
consumed by two speakers who advocated proposals of limited interest to the majority of the audience —
and who were no doubt relishing their chance to talk to a captive group of about 19,500. With our new
procedure, those shareholders who wish to hear it all can stick around for the formal meeting and those who
don’t can leave — or better yet shop.

There will be plenty of opportunity for that pastime in the vast exhibition hall that adjoins the
meeting area. Kelly Muchemore, the Flo Ziegfeld of Berkshire, put on a magnificent shopping
extravaganza last year, and she says that was just a warm-up for this year. (Kelly, I am delighted to report,
is getting married in October. I’m giving her away and suggested that she make a little history by holding
the wedding at the annual meeting. She balked, however, when Charlie insisted that he be the ringbearer.)

Again we will showcase a 2,100 square foot Clayton home (featuring Acme brick, Shaw carpet,
Johns Manville insulation, MiTek fasteners, Carefree awnings and NFM furniture). Take a tour through
the home. Better yet, buy it.

GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of
them ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a
special shareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 45 of the 50 jurisdictions in
which we operate. Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you
money.

On Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets®
available for your inspection. Stop by the NetJets booth at the Qwest to learn about viewing these planes.
Come to Omaha by bus; leave in your new plane.

The Bookworm shop did a terrific business last year selling Berkshire-related books. Displaying
18 titles, they sold 2,920 copies for $61,000. Since we charge the shop no rent (I must be getting soft), it
gives shareholders a 20% discount. This year I’ve asked The Bookworm to add Graham Allison’s Nuclear
Terrorism: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe, a must-read for those concerned with the safety of our
country. In addition, the shop will premiere Poor Charlie's Almanack, a book compiled by Peter Kaufman.
Scholars have for too long debated whether Charlie is the reincarnation of Ben Franklin. This book should
settle the question.

An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain
the credential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. As for plane, hotel and car
reservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. They do
a terrific job for us each year, and I thank them for it.

At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72™ Street between Dodge and Pacific,

we will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” pricing. We initiated this special event at NFM eight years
ago, and sales during the “Weekend” grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $25.1 million in 2004 (up 45%

25
from a year earlier). Every year has set a new record, and on Saturday of last year, we had the largest
single-day sales in NFM’s history — $6.1 million.

To get the discount, you must make your purchases between Thursday, April 28 and Monday,
May 2 inclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even apply to
the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but
that, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their
cooperation. NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on
Sunday. On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. we are having a special affair for shareholders
only. I’ll be there, eating barbeque and drinking Coke.

Borsheim’s — the largest jewelry store in the country except for Tiffany’s Manhattan store — will
have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday,
April 29. The second, the main gala, will be from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday, May 1. On Saturday, we
will be open until 6 p.m.

We will have huge crowds at Borsheim’s throughout the weekend. For your convenience,
therefore, shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 25 through Saturday, May 7. During
that period, just identify yourself as a shareholder through your meeting credentials or a brokerage
statement.

Borsheim’s operates on a gross margin that is fully twenty percentage points below that of its
major rivals, even before the shareholders’ discount. Last year, business over the weekend increased 73%
from 2003, setting a record that will be tough to beat. Show me it can be done.

In a tent outside of Borsheim’s, Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, will take on all comers
in groups of six — blindfolded. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the
world’s top bridge experts, available to play with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. They plan to keep
their eyes open — but Bob never sorts his cards, even when playing for a national championship.

Gorat’s — my favorite steakhouse — will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on
Sunday, May 1, and will be serving from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m. Please remember that to come to Gorat’s on
that day, you must have a reservation. To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 1 (but not before). If
Sunday is sold out, try Gorat’s on one of the other evenings you will be in town. Enhance your reputation
as an epicure by ordering, as I do, a rare T-bone with a double helping of hash browns.

We will again have a special reception from 4:00 to 5:30 on Saturday afternoon for shareholders
who have come from outside of North America. Every year our meeting draws many people from around
the globe, and Charlie and I want to be sure we personally greet those who have come so far. Last year we
enjoyed meeting more than 400 of you including at least 100 from Australia. Any shareholder who comes
from other than the U.S. or Canada will be given a special credential and instructions for attending this
function.

2 ee ok ke Ok oe Ok ok ok ok
Charlie and I are lucky. We have jobs that we love and are helped every day in a myriad of ways
by talented and cheerful associates. No wonder we tap-dance to work. But nothing is more fun for us than

getting together with our shareholder-partners at Berkshire’s annual meeting. So join us on April 30" at the
Qwest for our annual Woodstock for Capitalists.

 Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companie s to value the equity securities they hold at market rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was prev iously the requirement.  In this table, Berkshire’s results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rule s.  In all other respects, the results are calculated using the numbers originally reported. 
The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax.  If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appr opriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return.  Over the years, the tax cost s would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.
  
BER KSHIR E HATHAWAY  INC. 
 
 
To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hath away Inc. : 
 
 Our gain in net worth du ring 2005 was $5.6 billion, which increased  the per-share book  value of 
both our Class A an d Class B stock by 6.4%.  Over the last 41 y ears (that is, since present  managem ent 
took over) book value has grown from  $19 t o $59,377, a rate of 21.5% c ompounded annually.* 
 
 Berkshire ha d a decent year in 2005.  We initiated five acquisitions (two of whic h have yet to  
close) an d most of ou r operating su bsidiaries pros pered.  Even o ur insurance b usiness in its entirety did 
well, th ough Hurrican e Kat rina in flicted  record  losses on both Berk shire an d the indu stry.  We estim ate our 
loss fro m Katrin a at $2.5 billion – and  her ugly sisters, Rit a and Wilma, co st us an additional $.9 billion.  
 
 Cred it GEICO – and its brillian t CEO, To ny Nicely –  for our stellar in surance resu lts in a d isaster-
ridden year.  One statistic stan ds out: In  just two  years, GEICO im proved its p roductivity b y 32%.  
Remarkabl y, employment fell by 4% eve n as pol icy count grew by 26% – an d more gai ns are i n store.  
When we dri ve un it co sts d own in such a dram atic manner, we can offer ever-greater value to our 
customers.  The payoff: Last year, GEICO gained market-share, earned commenda ble profits and 
strengthened its brand.  If you have a new son or grandson in 2006, name him Tony . 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 My g oal in writin g this report is to  give you the info rmatio n you need to estimate Berk shire’s 
intrinsic value .  I say  “estimate” becaus e calculations  of intrinsic value, t hough all-im porta nt, are  
necessa rily impreci se and often seriously wrong.  The  more unce rtain the future of a business, the more 
possibility th ere is th at the calculation will b e wild ly off-base.  (Fo r an explanation  of intrinsic v alue, see 
page s 77 – 78.)  Here B erkshire has s ome adva ntages: a wide vari ety of relatively-stable earni ngs streams, 
combined with great  liquidity and minimum debt.  These factors m ean that Berks hire’s in trinsic v alue can  
be m ore precis ely calculated than can th e intrinsic value of m ost companies. 
 
 Yet if preci sion is aided by Berkshire’s financial ch aracteristics, th e job o f calcu lating in trinsic 
value has bee n made more com plex by the mere prese nce of s o many earni ngs st reams.  Back i n 1965, 
when we own ed only a sm all textile o peration , the task  of calcu lating intrinsic v alue was a sn ap.  No w we 
own 68 distinct businesses  with widely disparat e operating and financial charact eristics.  T his array of 
unrelated enterprises, coupled with our massive invest ment holdings, makes i t impossi ble for you to simply 
examine our consolidated financial state ments and arriv e at an  informed estimate of intrinsic value. 
 
 We h ave at tempted to ease t his problem by clustering our businesses into four logical groups, each 
of which we discu ss later in  this repo rt.  In th ese d iscussions, we will p rovide the key figures for bo th the 
group and its important com ponents.  Of course, the value of B erkshire may be ei ther great er or less than 
the sum  of these fo ur parts.  The o utcome depen ds on whether o ur many units function better or worse by 
being part of a larger e nterprise and whether capi tal allocation improves or deteriorates wh en it is un der the 
direction of a holding company.  In other words, does Berkshire ownership bring anything to the party, or 
would our s harehol ders be better off if they directly owne d sha res in each  of our 68 busi nesses ?  These are 
important questio ns but ones that you  will h ave to answer for you rself. 
 
 Before we look at our individual businesses, however, let’s review two sets of figures that show 
where we ’ve c ome from  and whe re we are now.  The fi rst set is the am ount of invest ments (including cash 
and cash-equivalents) we o wn on a per-share basi s.  In making this calculation, we excl ude investments 
held in our fina nce ope ration because these are largely offs et by borrowi ngs:

 When growth  rates are un der discussion , it will pay you  to be suspicious as to  why the beginning 
and term inal years h ave been selected .  If eith er year was aberratio nal, an y calcu lation of growth  will be 
distorted.  In part icular, a base y ear i n whi ch ear nings were poor can produce a breat htaking, but 
meaningless, growth rate.  In the table above, however, the base year of 1965 was abnormally good; 
Berk shire earned  more money in that year th an it d id in all bu t one of the previous ten. 
 
 As you can see f rom the two tab les, the com parative growth rates of Berkshire’s two elements of 
value have change d in the last decade, a  result re flecting our e ver-increasi ng em phasis on business  
acquisition s.  Nev ertheless, Ch arlie Mu nger, Berk shire’s Vice Ch airman and my p artner, and  I wan t to 
increase t he figures i n both tables.  In this ambition, we hope – metaphori cally – to avoid the fate of the 
elderly couple who had been  rom antically challenged for some time.  As they finished dinner on their 50th 
anniversa ry, however, the wife – st imulated by  soft music, wi ne and candlelight – felt a long-absent tickle 
and demurely suggested to her husband that they go u pstairs and m ake love.  He ag onized f or a m oment 
and then replied, “I can do one or the other, but not both.” 
 
Acquisiti ons 
 
 Over the years, our current businesses, in aggregate, should del iver modest growth in operating 
earnings.  Bu t they will n ot in themselves produce tru ly satisfacto ry gains.  We will n eed major acq uisitions 
to get that job done. 
 
 In this quest, 2005 was encouraging.  We agreed  to five purch ases: two  that were co mpleted  last 
year, one that closed after ye arend a nd two others that we expect  to cl ose soon.  None of the deals invo lve 
the issuance of Berkshi re sha res.  That ’s a c rucial, but often ignored, point: Whe n a managem ent proudly 
acqui res a nother company for stock, the shareholders of the acquirer are concurrently selling part of their 
interest in  everyth ing they own.  I’ve made this kind of deal a few times myse lf – and, on balance, my 
actions have cost you money . 
 
 4 Here  are last y ear’s  purchases :  
 
• On June 3 0 we bo ught Medical Protective Com pany (“MedPro”), a 106-year- old medical 
malp ractice insurer b ased in Fort Wayne.  Malp ractice insura nce is tough to underwri te and has 
proved to be a graveyard  for many insurers.  Med Pro nevertheless shou ld do well.  It will h ave the 
attitu dinal advantage that all Berk shire in surers share, wherein  underwri ting discipline trumps all 
other goals.  Additionally, as part of Berk shire, MedPro has financial streng th far ex ceeding that of 
its co mpetitors, a quality assu ring doctors t hat lon g-to-set tle clai ms will not end up back on their 
doorstep because their ins urer failed.  Fi nally, the com pany has a sm art and e nergetic CEO, Tim 
Kenesey, who instinctively thin ks like a Berk shire manager. 
 
• Forest Riv er, our seco nd acquisition , closed on Augu st 31.  A co uple of months earlier, on  June 
21, I recei ved a two-pa ge fa x telling me – point by point – why Forest River m et the ac quisition 
criteria we set  fort h on page 25 o f this report.  I ha d not  before he ard of the co mpany, a 
recreation al vehicle manufacturer with  $1.6 billion of sales, nor of Pete Lieg l, its owner and 
manager .  But the fax made sense, a nd I immediately asked for m ore figures.  T hese ca me the next  
morning, and that afternoon I made Pet e an offer.  On June 28, we shook hands on a deal. 
 
Pete is a remarkable en trepreneur.  So me years back, he sold his business, then far smaller than 
today, to a n LBO operat or who prom ptly bega n telling him how to run th e place.  Before long, 
Pete left, and the business soon sunk into bankruptcy.  Pete then repurchased i t.  You can be sure 
that I won’t be telling Pet e how to manage hi s operation. 
 
Forest River has 60 plants, 5,400 em ployees and has c onsistently gained share in the RV business, 
while also e xpandi ng into other areas s uch as boats .  Pete is 61 – and definitely in an acceleration

Berks hire are made for ea ch other. 
 
• On November 12, 2005, an article ran  in The Wall Street Journal deal ing with Berkshire’s unusual 
acquisition  and managerial practices.  In  it Pete d eclared, “It was easier to  sell my b usiness th an to 
renew my driver’s license.” 
 
In New Yo rk, Cath y Baro n Tamraz read  the article, and it struc k a chord.  On Novem ber 21, she 
sent m e a letter that  began, “As  president  of Business Wire, I’d lik e to introduce you to my 
company, as I believe it fits th e profile o f Berkshire Hath away sub sidiary companies as d etailed  in 
a recen t Wall Street Jou rnal article.” 
 
By th e time I finished Cathy’s two-p age letter, I felt Busi ness Wire  and Berk shire  were a fit.  I 
particula rly lik ed her penultimate paragra ph: “We run a tight shi p and keep  unnecessary spendi ng 
under wraps.  No secret aries or m anagem ent layers he re.  Yet  we’ll invest big dollars to gain a 
technological a dvantage  and move the busi ness forward.” 
 
I prom ptly gave Cathy a call, and before l ong Berks hire had reache d agreem ent with Busi ness 
Wire’s controlling shareholder, Lorry Lokey, who founded the com pany in 1961 (and who had 
just made Cathy CEO).  I love success st ories like Lorry’s.  Today  78, he  has built a com pany t hat 
dissem inates inf ormation in 150 co untries for 25,000 clients.  Hi s story, like those of m any 
entrepreneurs who have sel ected B erkshire as a hom e for their life’s work, is  an exam ple of what  
can happe n when a good i dea, a talented  individual and hard work converge. 
 
• In Decem ber we agreed to buy 81% of Applied Underwriters, a  com pany that offe rs a combination 
of pay roll services a nd workers’ compensation insurance to small businesses.   A majority of 
Applied’s c ustomers are located in Californ ia. 
 
 
 
 5In 1998, though, when the company had 12 em ployees, it acqui red a n Om aha-base d operation 
with 24 em ployees that offe red a som ewhat-similar service.  Sid Ferenc and St eve Menzies, wh o 
have built App lied’s remarkable bu siness, co ncluded that O maha had many advantages as an 
operation al base – a brillia nt insight, I might add  – and tod ay 400  of the co mpany’s 479 
employees are located here . 
 
Less than a year ago, Appl ied entere d into a large rein suran ce con tract with  Ajit Jain , the 
extraordinary manager of Natio nal Ind emnity’s re insuran ce division.  Ajit was im pressed  by Sid 
and Steve, a nd they liked Berk shire’s method of operation.  So  we decide d to join forces .  We are 
pleased that Si d and Steve  retain 19% of Applied.  They started on a s hoestring only 12  years ago , 
and it will b e fun to see what they can  accom plish with Berk shire’s backing. 
 
• Last spri ng, MidAm erican Ener gy, our 80.5% owned subsidiary, agreed t o buy PacifiCorp, a 
major electric u tility serv ing six Western states.  An acquisition  of this so rt requires m any 
regulatory approvals, bu t we’ve now obtained these and expect to close this tran sactio n soon . 
Berk shire will then buy $3.4 billion of MidAm erican ’s commo n stock, which MidAmerican  will 
supplement with  $1.7 billion of borro wing to complete th e purchase.  You can’t ex pect to earn 
outsized  profits in  regulated utilities, b ut the in dustry offers own ers the opportun ity to  deploy large 
sums at fai r returns – an d therefore, it makes go od se nse for Berks hire.  A few years back, I said 
that we hoped to make some very larg e purchases in the utility field .  No te the plural – we’ll b e 
looking for more. 
 
 In addition to buying these new op eration s, we co ntinue to make “bolt-on” acquisition s.  So me 
aren’t so sm all: Sh aw, our  carpet operation , spent abou t $550 million last year  on two pu rchases that 
furth ered its vertical in tegration and shou ld improve its profit m argin in th e future.  XTRA and  Clayto n 
Hom es also m ade value-enhancing acquisitions. 
 
 Unlike many business buyers, Berkshire has no “exi t strategy.”  We buy to keep .  We do, though, 
have an entrance strateg y, look ing for businesses in  this coun try or abroad that meet our s ix criteria and are 
availab le at a p rice th at will p roduce a reaso nable return.  If you  have a business that fits, g ive me a call.   
Like a hopeful teenage girl, I’ll b e waitin g by the phone. 
 
Insur ance 
 
 Let’s now  talk abo ut our four sector s and  start with insuran ce, our core business.  What coun ts 
here is the am ount of “fl oat” and its cost over tim e. 
 
 For new rea ders, let m e explain.  “Floa t” is money that do esn’t belo ng to us but that we 
temporarily hold.  Most of our fl oat arises because (1) pre miums are pa id upfront though  the servic e we  
provide – insurance protection – i s delivered over a pe riod that usual ly cove rs a y ear and; (2) loss events 
that occur toda y do not always resu lt in our immediately p aying claim s, because it sometim es takes many 
years for lo sses to  be repo rted (asb estos lo sses wou ld be an example), negotiated  and settled .  Th e $20 
million of flo at that ca me with our 1967 entry in to insurance has n ow increased – both by way  of internal 
growth and acquisition s – to $49 billion. 
 
 Float is wonderful – if it doesn’t come at a high price.  Its co st is d etermined by underwritin g 
results, m eaning how th e expen ses an d losses we will ultimatel y pay com pare with  the premiums we h ave 
receive d.  Whe n an insurer earns a n unde rwriting profit – as has been t he case at Be rkshire in a bout hal f of 
the 39 y ears we ha ve bee n in the insurance b usiness – float is b etter th an free.  In su ch years, we are  
actually paid for holding other people’s money .  Fo r most insure rs, howeve r, life  has bee n far more 
diffic ult: In aggre gate, the prope rty-casualty indust ry alm ost inva riably operates at an underwriting l oss.  
When that loss is larg e, float becomes exp ensive, sometimes devastatin gly so. 
 
 
 
 6 In 2004 our float cost  us less than nothing, and I told you that we had a chance  – absent a mega-
catastrophe – of no-cost float in 200 5.  B ut we had the mega-cat, and as a specialis t in that coverage, 
Berk shire suffered  hurrican e losses o f $3.4 billion.  Nev ertheless, o ur float was costless in 2005 because of 
the superb results we had in our other insurance activ ities, particularly at GEIC O. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 Auto policies in force gre w by 12.1% at GE ICO, a gain i ncreasing its m arket s hare of U.S. private 
passe nger aut o busi ness f rom about 5.6% t o about 6.1%.  Aut o insurance is a bi g business:  Each s hare-
point equates to $1.6 billion in sales. 
 
 While ou r brand streng th is not quantifiab le, I b elieve it also  grew sign ifican tly.  W hen Berk shire 
acqui red c ontrol of GEICO in 1996, its annual advertising expenditures were $31 m illion.  Last  year we 
were up  to $502 million.  And I can ’t wait to spend more. 
 
 Our adve rtising works because we ha ve a great  story to tell: More pe ople can sa ve money by 
insuring  with  us than is th e case with  any other national carrier offering  policies to  all co mers.  (So me 
specialized aut o insure rs do partic ularly well for a pplicants fitting i nto their niches; also, because our  
national competitors use rati ng system s that differ from ours, they will so metimes b eat o ur price.)  Last 
year, we ac hieved by far the highest conversion rate – the perce ntage of internet and phone quotes turned 
into sales – in ou r history.  This is po werfu l evidence that our prices a re more attract ive relativ e to the 
competitio n than ever before.  Test us by going to GEIC O.co m or by callin g 800-847-7536.  Be su re to 
indicate you  are a sh areholder because that fact will o ften qualify you  for a discount. 
 
 I told you last year abo ut GEICO’s en try into  New Jersey in  August, 2004.  Drivers in that state 
love us.  Our retention rate there for new policyholders is running higher than in any other state, an d by 
sometime in  2007, GEIC O is likely to  become the third largest au to insu rer in New Jersey.  There, as 
elsewh ere, our low co sts allow low prices that lead  to steady g ains in profitab le business. 
 
 That simple form ula im mediately impressed m e 55 y ears ago when I first discovered GEIC O.  
Indeed, at age 21, I wrote an article about the company – it’s reproduced on page 24 – when its market 
value was $ 7 million.  As y ou can see , I cal led GE ICO “T he Sec urity I Like B est.”  An d that’s what I still 
call it.  
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 We ha ve m ajor reins urance operatio ns at G eneral Re and National Indemnity.  The fo rmer is run 
by Joe Brandon and Tad Montross, the latter by Ajit Jain.  Bo th un its performed well in  2005 considering 
the extraordinary hu rrican e losses th at battered  the ind ustry. 
 
 It’s a n open question whet her atm ospheric, ocea nic or other causal factors ha ve dra matically 
change d the freque ncy or int ensity of hurri canes.  R ecent expe rience is worris ome.  We know, for ins tance, 
that in  the 100  year s before 2004, abou t 59 hurricanes of Catego ry 3 strength, or  greater , hit th e 
Southeastern a nd Gulf Coast states, and that  only three of these we re Catego ry 5s.  We f urther k now that in 
2004 there were three C ategory 3 storms that ham mered those areas  and that these were foll owed by four 
more in 2005, one of them, Katrina, the most destructive hurricane in industry history.  Mor eover, there 
were th ree Categ ory 5s near th e coast last ye ar that fortunat ely weak ened before landfall. 
 
 Was t his on slaught of more frequ ent and  more in tense sto rms merely an anomaly?  Or was it 
cause d by changes in climate, wat er temperature or other variables we don’t fully understand?  And could 
these fact ors be d eveloping in a manner that will soo n prod uce disasters dwarfing Katrina?  
 
 Joe, Ajit and I don’t know the an swer t o these all-i mportant questio ns.  What  we do k now is that 
our ign orance means we must fo llow th e course prescrib ed by Pascal in  his fam ous wag er abou t the 
existence o f God.  As y ou may recal l, he concl uded that since he di dn’t know the answer, his per sonal 
gain/loss ratio dictated  an affirmative conclusion. 
 
 
 7 So guided, we’ve concluded that we s hould now write mega-cat  policies onl y at prices f ar higher 
than prev ailed  last year –  and then only with  an aggregate expos ure that woul d not cau se us distres s if shifts  
in some important variable produ ce far m ore co stly sto rms in  the near future.  To  a lesser d egree, we felt 
this way  after 2004 – and cut back our writings when prices didn’t move.  No w our caution has i ntensified.  
If prices seem  appropriate, howev er, we contin ue to have both the ability an d the app etite to  be the larges t 
writer of mega-cat  coverage in the world.

 Our sm aller in surers, with MedPro added to the fold, delivered  truly outstan ding results last year.  
Howe ver, what you see in the  table be low does not do full jus tice to their perform ance.  That’s because  we 
increased  the l oss reserv es of MedPro by about $125 million immed iately after our purchase. 
 
 No one knows with any precisio n what amo unt will be required to  pay the claim s we in herited.  
Medical malpractice insura nce is a “l ong-tai l” line, meaning that claim s often take m any years to settle.  In  
addition, there are o ther losses th at have occurred, but that we won ’t even hear abou t for some time.  On e 
thing, though, we h ave learn ed – the hard way –  after m any years in  the business: Su rprises in  insuran ce are 
far from symmetr ical.  Y ou ar e lucky if yo u get one that is pleasan t for ev ery ten th at go the other way.  
Too often, howeve r, insurers react to  loom ing loss  proble ms with optim ism.  They be have like  the fellow in 
a swi tchblade fight who, after his opponent has t aken a  mighty swipe at his throat, excl aimed, “Y ou never 
touched me.”  H is adversary ’s rep ly: “Ju st wait until yo u try to  shake your head.” 
 
 Excluding the reser ves we a dded for prior periods, MedPro wrote at an underwriting profit.  And 
our other primary com panies, in aggregate, had a n underwriting profit of $324 million on $1,270 m illion of 
volume.  Th is is an  extraordinary result, and ou r thanks go  to Rod Eldred of Berk shire Hathaway  
Homestate Co mpanies, Joh n Kizer of Cen tral States In demnity, To m Nern ey of U. S. Liability, Don  Towle 
of Kansas B ankers Surety and Don Wurster of National Indemnity.

Regulated Uti lity Business 
 
 We ha ve an 80.5% (fully diluted) interest in MidAm erican Ene rgy Holdings, which owns a wide 
variety o f utility o peration s.  The larg est of these are (1 ) Yorkshire Electricity  and Northern Electric, wh ose 
3.7 million electric cu stomers m ake it t he third larg est d istribu tor of electricity in  the U.K.; (2) 
MidAm erican Energy, whic h serves 706,000 electric customers,  primarily in Iowa; an d (3) Kern  River and 
Northern Natural pipelines, w hich car ry 7.8% of the natural gas co nsum ed in the U.S.  Whe n our Paci fiCorp 
acquisition  closes, we will ad d 1.6 million electric cu stomers in six Western  states, with Orego n and Utah 
providing us the most business.  Th is tran sactio n will increase Mid American ’s rev enues by $3.3 billion and  
its assets b y $14.1 billion. 
 
 
 
 
 
 8 The Pub lic Utili ty Ho lding Co mpany Act (“PUHC A”) was rep ealed o n Aug ust 8, 2 005, a 
milesto ne that allo wed Berk shire to  convert its Mid American p referred stock i nto voting com mon share s on 
February 9, 2 006.  Thi s conversion ended a con voluted corporate arrangem ent that PUHC A ha d forced  
upon us.  No w we have 83.4% of b oth the com mon st ock and t he votes at MidAm erican, w hich allows us 
to cons olidate the com pany’s inc ome for fina ncial accounting a nd tax purposes .  Our true ec onom ic 
interest, howe ver, is the aforem entioned 80.5%, since t here are options outstanding that are sure t o be 
exercised  within a few years an d that upon exercise will d ilute our ownership. 
 
 Though our voting pow er has in creased  dramatically, the dynamics of our four-party ownership 
have  not changed at all.  We view M idAm erican as a  partnership am ong Berkshire, Walter Scott, and two 
terrific m anagers, Dave Sokol and Greg Abel.  It’s unimportant how many votes each party has; we  will 
make major m oves only whe n we a re unanimous i n thinking them wise.  Five years o f working with Dave , 
Greg and Walter have  underscored my original belief: Berkshire couldn’t have better partners. 
 
 You will n otice th at this year  we h ave provided you with  two balance sheets, o ne representing our 
actual figures per GAAP on Decem ber 31, 2005 (which does not consolidate MidAm erican) a nd one  that 
reflects th e sub sequent conversion  of our preferred .  All fu ture fin ancial repo rts of Berk shire will in clude 
MidAm erican’s figures. 
 
 Somewhat incongruously, Mid American owns the seco nd largest real estate b rokerage firm  in the 
U.S.  And it’s a gem .  The parent com pany’s nam e is HomeServices of  America, bu t our 19,200 agen ts 
operate through 18 locally-branded firms.  Aided by three small acqui sitions, we participated in $64 billion 
of transactions last year, u p 6.5% from 2004. 
 
 Currently, th e white-ho t market in residential real estate of rece nt years i s cool ing down, and that 
should lead  to ad ditional acqu isition possibilities fo r us.  Both we and  Ron Peltier, t he company’s CEO,  
expect Hom eServices to be fa r larger a deca de from  now.

 9Finance  and F inancial Prod ucts 
 
 The st ar of our finance s ector is Clayton Homes, masterful ly run by Kevin Clayton.  He does not 
owe his brillian t reco rd to a rising tide: The manufactured-housing business has been disappo inting since 
Berks hire purc hased Clayton in 2003.  Indus try sales have  stagnate d at 40-year lows, a nd the recent uptick  
from  Katrina-related dem and will alm ost certainly be  short-live d.  In rece nt years, m any industry  
participants have suffered losses, and only Clayton ha s earned significant money . 
 
 In this brutal e nvironm ent Clayton has bought a large am ount of manufac tured-housi ng loans from  
major banks that found them unp rofitable and difficult to servi ce.  Clayton’s operating ex pertise and 
Berkshire’s financi al resources have m ade this an exce llent busi ness fo r us a nd one in whi ch we are 
preeminent.  We presen tly serv ice $17  billion of loans, com pared to $5.4 billon at th e time o f our purchase.  
Moreover, Clayto n now own s $9.6 billion of its serv icing  portfolio, a position built up almost entirely sin ce 
Berk shire en tered  the picture. 
 
 To finance th is portfolio, Clayto n borrows money fro m Berkshire, wh ich in turn borrows th e sam e 
amount publicly.  For t he use of its credit, Berkshire charges Clayton a o ne percent age-point markup on its 
borrowing cos t.  In 2 005, the cost  to Clayton for this arrangem ent was $ 83 million.  That  amount is 
included in “Other” income in the table on t he faci ng page, and C layton’s earni ngs of $416 m illion are aft er 
deducting  this payment. 
 
 On the manufacturing side, Clayton has also b een activ e.  To  its o riginal base of twen ty plants, it 
first added twelve more in 2004 by way  of the ban kruptcy purchase of O akwood, which just  a few years 
earlier wa s one  of the la rgest companies in t he business.  Then in 2005 Clayton purchased Karst en, a four-
plant operation th at greatly stren gthens Clayto n’s position on the West Co ast. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 Long ago, Mark  Twain  said: “A m an who  tries to  carry a cat h ome by its tail will lear n a lesso n 
that can  be learned in no other way.”  If Twain were around now, he might try winding up a der ivativ es 
business.  After a few  days, he would opt  for cats. 
 
 We lo st $1 04 million pre-tax  last year in  our con tinuing atte mpt to exit Gen  Re’s derivative 
operation.  Our aggregate losses since we began this endeavor total $404 million. 
 
 Originally w e had 23,218 contracts ou tstand ing.  By th e start of 2005 we were dow n to 2,890.  
You might expect th at ou r losses wou ld have been stemme d by this point, but the blood h as kept flowing.  
Reducing our inventory to 741  contracts last y ear co st us the $1 04 million men tioned above. 
 
 Remember th at th e rationale fo r estab lishing this un it in 19 90 was Gen Re’s wish to  meet th e 
need s of insurance cl ients.  Yet one of the cont racts we liquidated in 2005 had a t erm of 1 00 years!  It ’s 
diffic ult to im agine what “nee d” such a contract coul d fulfill except, perhaps, the nee d of a compensation-
consciou s trader to h ave a lon g-dated contract o n his book s.  Long contracts, or alter natively th ose with 
multiple variables, are the m ost difficult to mark to m arket (the stan dard proce dure use d in accounting for 
derivatives) and  provide the most opportunity fo r “imagination” when trad ers are estimatin g their v alue.  
Small wo nder that trad ers prom ote them. 
 
 A business in which huge amounts of compensat ion flow from assum ed numbers is obviously 
fraught with danger.  When t wo traders execute a transact ion that has se veral, som etimes esot eric, variables 
and a far-o ff settle ment date, th eir resp ective firm s must subsequently value these co ntracts wh enever they 
calculate their earni ngs.  A gi ven c ontract may be val ued at one price by  Firm A and at  anot her by Firm B.  
You can bet that the val uation differences – and I’m personally fam iliar with  several that were huge – ten d 
to be tilted in a direction fa voring hi gher e arnings at each firm .  It’s a st range worl d in which two pa rties 
can ca rry out a paper transaction that each can promptly report  as profitable. 
 
 I dwell on our expe rience  in derivative s each year for two reas ons.  One is pe rsonal and 
unpleasant.  The hard fact is that I have c ost you a l ot of money  by not moving immediately to close do wn 
 10Gen Re’s trad ing operation .  Both Charlie an d I knew at  the time of the Gen  Re pu rchase th at it was a 
problem an d told its management that we wan ted to exit the business.  It was my resp onsibility to mak e 
sure t hat happened.  Rather than address t he situation hea d on, however, I wast ed se veral years w hile we 
attempted to sell the operat ion.  That  was  a doom ed en deav or beca use no real istic solution could have  
extricated  us from the maze of liab ilities th at was go ing to ex ist fo r decades.  Our obligation s were  
particula rly worrisom e because thei r pote ntial to explode could not be measured.  More over, if s evere 
trouble occurred, we knew it was lik ely to co rrelat e with prob lems elsewh ere in  financial markets. 
 
 So I failed  in my atte mpt to exit painlessly, and  in the mean time more trad es were put on the 
books.  Fau lt me fo r dithering.  (Charlie calls it thumb-suc king.)  When a problem exists, whet her in 
personnel or in bu siness operations, the tim e to act is now. 
 
 The seco nd reason  I reg ularly d escrib e our prob lems in this area lies in  the ho pe th at our 
expe riences may prove instructive for m anagers , auditors and re gulators.  In a sense , we are a canary in this  
business co al mine and should  sing  a son g of warning as we expire.  The nu mber and value of derivativ e 
contracts out standing in the world continues to mushroom and i s now a m ultiple of wh at existed in 1998, 
the last ti me that fin ancial ch aos erup ted. 
 
 Our e xperie nce should be  particularly sobering because we we re a better-tha n-ave rage candidate  
to exit gracefully.  Ge n Re was a  relativel y minor operat or in t he derivatives field.  It has had the good 
fortune to unwind its supposedly liquid positions i n a benign market, all the whi le free of financial or other 
press ures t hat might have forced it to conduct the liquidation in a less-than-efficient manner.  Our 
accounting in the past was conventiona l and actually thought to be conser vative.  Additionally, we know of  
no bad behavior by anyone involved. 
 
 It co uld be a differen t story for others in  the future.  Imag ine, if yo u will, o ne or more fir ms 
(troub les o ften spread) with  positions that are many multiples of ours atte mpting to liquidate in ch aotic 
markets and unde r extrem e, and well-publicized, press ures.  Th is is a s cenario to which much atten tion 
should be gi ven now rather than aft er the fact.  The t ime to have c onsidered – an d improved – t he reliability 
of New Orlea ns’ levee s was before Katrin a. 
 
 When we finally win d up Gen Re Securities, m y feelin gs about its d eparture will b e akin to tho se 
expressed  in a country son g, “My w ife ran aw ay w ith m y best friend, an d I sure miss him a lo t.”

 12• In both our building-products companies and  at Shaw, we continue to be hit by rising cos ts for raw 
materials and energy.  Most of these operations a re sign ificant users of oil (o r more sp ecifically,  
petrochemicals) and natural gas.  And prices fo r these co mmodities h ave soared. 
  
We, l ikewise, have raised prices on m any products, but there are often l ags be fore inc reases be-
come effect ive.  Nevertheless, both our building-products operations and Shaw delivered respect-
able resu lts in 2005, a fact att ributable to th eir strong business franc hises and able managements. 
 
• In apparel, ou r larg est u nit, Fru it of the Lo om, again incre ased earnings and m arket-s hare.  You 
know, of course, of our leadersh ip position in men’s and boys’ unde rwear, in which we account 
for about 48.7% of the sales recorde d by mass-m arketers (Wal-Mart, Ta rget, etc.).  T hat’s up from  
44.2% in 2002, whe n we ac quired the com pany.  Operating from a sm aller base, we have m ade 
still g reater g ains in intimate apparel fo r women and girls that is so ld by the mass-mark eters, 
climbing fr om 13.7% of t heir sales in 2002 to 24.7% in 2005.  A gai n like that in a major cat egory 
doesn’t com e easy .  Thank John Holland, Fruit’s extraordinary CEO, for making this happen. 
 
• I told you last year th at Ben  Brid ge (jewelry) a nd R. C. Willey (ho me furnishings) had same-store 
sales gai ns far above the average o f their industries.  You might think that blow-out figures in one 
year wo uld mak e comparison s difficu lt in the following year.  Bu t Ed and Jon  Bridge at th eir 
operation  and Scott Hym as at R. C. Willey were m ore than up to th is challen ge.  Ben Bridge had a 
6.6% same-store gain in 2005, and  R. C. Willey ca me in at 9.9%. 
 
Our never-on-Sun day app roach at R. C. Willey co ntinues to overwh elm seven-day competitors as 
we roll out stores in new m arkets.  The Bois e store, about which I was such a skeptic a few ye ars 
back , had a 21% gai n in 2005, coming of f a 10% gain in 2004.  Our new Reno store, opened in 
Novem ber, broke  out of the  gate fast with sales that exc eeded Boise’s early pace, a nd we will  
begin busine ss in Sacram ento in June .  If thi s store succeeds as I expect it to, Californians will see 
many more R. C. Willey sto res in the years to  come. 
 
• In flight services, ea rnings improve d at FlightSafety as c orporate aviation continued its rebound.  
To support growth, we invest h eavily in ne w sim ulators.  Our m ost recent expansi on, bri nging us 
to 42 training cen ters, is a major facility at Farn borough, Eng land that opened in September.  
When it is fully built ou t in 2007, we will h ave invested more th an $100 million in the building 
and its 15  simu lators.  Bru ce Whitman, Flig htSafety’s ab le CEO, m akes sure th at no competitor 
comes close to offering the breadth and depth of services that we do. 
 
Operating res ults at NetJets were a di fferent story .  I sai d last year th at this business would earn 
money in 2005 – and I was dead wrong. 
 
Our European operat ion, it should be not ed, showed both excel lent growth and a reduce d loss.  
Custom er cont racts there inc reased by 37% .  We are t he only fractional-ownership operation of 
any size in Euro pe, a nd our now-pervasive prese nce there is a key  factor i n making NetJets the 
worldwid e lead er in this ind ustry. 
 
Despite a la rge increase  in c ustom ers, however, our U.S. operation dipped far into the red .  Its 
efficien cy fell, and  costs soared.  We b elieve that our three la rgest co mpetitors suffered  similar 
problem s, but each is owne d by ai rcraft m anufact urers that may thi nk differently than we do a bout 
the necessi ty of m aking ade quate profits.  The combi ned value of the fleets managed by  these 
three c ompetitors , in any ca se, continues t o be less valua ble than the fleet that we  operate. 
 
Rich  Santulli, one of the most dynamic managers I’v e ever m et, will so lve our rev enue/expense 
problem.  He won ’t do it, howev er, in  a manner that impairs th e quality o f the NetJets ex perience.  
Both he and I are co mmitted  to a lev el of service, secu rity and safety t hat can ’t be match ed by 
others. 
 
 13• Our retailing category includes See’s  Candies, a c ompany we bought early in 1972 (a date making 
it our oldest non-insurance  business).  At that time, Charlie and I immediately deci ded to put 
Chuck Huggins, th en 46, in charge.  Thoug h we were new  at th e game o f selectin g managers, 
Charlie and  I hit a h ome run with this appo intment.  Ch uck’s love for the cu stomer and  the brand 
perm eated the organization, which in his 34-year tenure produced a m ore-than-tenfold increase i n 
profits.  Th is gain was ach ieved in an indu stry growing at b est slowly an d perhaps no t at all.  
(Volume figures in this industry are hard to pin down.) 
 
At yeare nd, Chuck turned the reins  at See ’s over  to Brad K instler , who pr eviously had served 
Berkshire well while running Cypress  Insurance a nd Fec hheimer’s.  It’s unusual for us to move 
managers a round, but Brad’s reco rd m ade hi m an obvi ous choice for the See’s j ob.  I h ope C huck 
and his wife, Donna, a re at the annual m eeting.  If they are, sha reholders can join Cha rlie and m e 
in giving America’s n umber one candy maker a richly-deserved round of applause.

 Every day, in countless ways, th e competitiv e position of each  of our businesses grows eith er 
weake r or stronger.  If we a re del ighting customers, el iminating u nnecessary  cost s and i mproving our 
products and services, we gain strength.  B ut if we t reat customers wi th indifference or tolerate bloat, our 
businesses will with er.  On  a daily basis, th e effects of our actio ns are im perceptible; cum ulatively, th ough, 
their consequences a re enormous. 
 
 Whe n our l ong-term  com petitive position improves as a  result of these almost unnoticeable  
actions, we des cribe the phenomenon as “wi dening the moat.”  An d doing that is essent ial if we are t o have  
the kind of bus iness we want a decade or two from  now .  We always, of course, hope t o earn m ore money  
in the sho rt-term.  But when short-term  and long-term  conflict, wid ening the moat must  take precede nce.  If 
a managem ent makes bad d ecisions i n order t o hit short-term earni ngs targets, and co nsequently gets 
behind the eight-ball in terms of cost s, customer sat isfaction or brand strength, no am ount of s ubsequent 
brillian ce will o vercome the damage that has b een inflicted .  Tak e a look at th e dilemmas o f managers in 
the au to and airlin e industries to day as th ey strugg le with  the hug e problems handed them by their 
predecessors.  Charlie is fond of quoting Ben Franklin’s “An ounce of preventi on is worth a pound of 
cure.”  B ut someti mes n o amount of cure will o vercome the mistak es of t he past. 
 
 Our m anagers focus on moat-wid ening – and are brillian t at it.  Quite sim ply, they are p assion ate 
about their businesses.  Usually, they were ru nning those long before we cam e along; our only function 
since has bee n to stay out  of the way .  If y ou see t hese her oes – an d our four heroines as wel l – at  the 
annual meetin g, thank them for th e job  they do for you .

 The attitu de of ou r managers vividly contrasts with  that of the you ng man who married  a tyco on’s 
only child, a decidedly homely and dul l lass.  R elieved, the fath er called  in his new so n-in-law after th e 
wedding and began to discuss the future: 
“Son , you ’re the boy I always w anted and n ever had.  H ere’s a stoc k certificate for 50% of the 
company.  You’re m y equal  partner from now on.” 
“Tha nks, dad .” 
 “Now, what would you like to run? How about sales?” 
“I’m  afraid I couldn’t sell wa ter to a man crawlin g in the Sah ara.” 
“Well then, how about heading human relatio ns?” 
“I really don’t care for people .” 
“No problem, we have  lots of other spots in the business.   What  would you like to do?” 
“Actually, no thing appeals to m e.  Why don’t you  just buy me o ut?”

*This is our actual purchase price and al so our tax basis; GAAP “c ost” differs in a few case s 
because of write-ups or write-downs that ha ve bee n require d. 
 
 A couple of la st year’s cha nges in our portfolio  occurred because of c orporate e vents: Gillette  was 
merg ed into Procter & Gam ble, an d American Exp ress s pun off Am eriprise.  In  addition, we sub stantially 
increased  our holdings in Wells Farg o, a co mpany that Dick  Kov acevich runs brillian tly, an d estab lished 
positions in Anheuser-Bu sch and Wal-Mart. 
 
 Expect no miracles fr om our equi ty portfolio.  T hough we own major interests in a number of  
strong, highly-profitable businesses, t hey are not  selling at  anything like bargain prices.  As a g roup, they 
may d ouble in value in ten years.  Th e likelihood is th at their p er-share earn ings, in aggregate, will g row 6-
8% per year o ver the decade and  that their sto ck prices will more or less match that growth .  (Th eir 
managers , of course, think my expect ations are too modest  – and I hope they’re right.) 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 The P&G-Gillette merger, cl osing in the fourth qu arter o f 2005, requ ired Berk shire to  record  a 
$5.0 billion pre-tax  capital g ain.  Th is bookkeeping entry, d ictated  by GAAP, is mean ingless from an  
econ omic standp oint, and you should ignore it when  you are eval uating Berkshire’s 2005 ea rnings.  We 
didn’t intend to sell o ur Gillette sh ares b efore th e merger; we do n’t in tend to sell o ur P&G sh ares now; an d 
we inc urred no tax when the merger t ook place. 
 
 It’s h ard to overem phasize th e importance of who  is CEO o f a co mpany.  Befo re Jim Kilts arriv ed 
at Gillette  in 2001, the com pany was strugg ling, having particularly suffered  from cap ital-allo catio n 
blunde rs.  In the m ajor exa mple, Gillette’ s acquisiti on of Duracell cost Gillette sharehol ders billions of 
dollars, a loss never m ade visible by conventional accounting.  Quite simply, what Gillette  received in 
business value in this acquisition was  not equi valent to what it gave u p.  (Amazingly, this most 
fundamental of yardsticks is alm ost always i gnored by  both managem ents and their investment bankers  
when acqu isitio ns are und er discu ssion .) 
 
 
 
 15 Upon  taking office at Gillett e, Jim quickly in stilled  fiscal d iscipline, tig htened operations and 
energized marketing, m oves that dramatically in creas ed th e intrinsic v alue of the company.  Gillette’s 
merger with P&G the n expa nded the potential of bot h com panies.  For his accom plishments, Jim  was paid 
very well – but he earned e very pe nny.  (This is no acade mic evaluati on: As a 9.7% owne r of Gillette, 
Berk shire in  effect paid th at propo rtion  of his compensatio n.)  Indeed, it’s difficu lt to overpay th e truly 
extraordinary CEO of a giant enterprise.  B ut this species is rare. 
 
 Too often, executive compensatio n in the U.S. is ridiculously o ut of lin e with perform ance.  That 
won’t change, moreover , because t he deck  is stacked  against investors when it comes to the CEO’s pay.  
The u pshot is that a mediocre- or-worse CEO – ai ded by his handpicked VP of human rel ations and a 
consultant from the ever-acc omm odating fi rm of Ratche t, Ratchet and B ingo – all too often receive s gobs 
of money fro m an ill-d esigned compensation  arran gement. 
 
 Take, for instance, ten  year, fixed-price options (and who wo uldn’t?).  If Fred Futile, CEO of 
Stagnant, Inc., receives a bundle of these – let’s say enough to give him  an opti on on 1% of t he com pany – 
his self-in terest is clear: He sh ould sk ip dividends entirely and instea d use all of t he company’s earnings  to 
repurchase stock. 
 
 Let’s ass ume that under Fre d’s leade rship Stagna nt lives up to its n ame.  In each  of the ten  years 
after th e option grant, it earns $1  billion on $10 billion of net worth, which initially comes to  $10 per share 
on the 100 m illion sha res then outstanding.  Fred esc hews dividends and regularly uses al l earni ngs to 
repurchase sh ares.  If th e stock  constan tly sells at  ten times earn ings per share, it will h ave appreciated 
158%  by t he end of t he option period.  T hat’s because  repurchases  would reduce t he number of s hares to 
38.7 million by that time, and earnings per share  would ther eby increase to $25.80.  Simply by withho lding 
earni ngs f rom owners, Fre d gets very  rich, m aking a cool  $158 m illion, des pite the business i tself 
improving not at all.  Astonishingly, Fred coul d have m ade more than $100 million if Stagna nt’s ea rnings 
had declined  by 20% during the ten-year period. 
 
 Fred can also get a splendid resul t for himself by paying no dividends and deploying the earnings 
he withholds from share holders into a variety of disappointing projects and acquisitions.  Even if these 
initiativ es deliver a paltry 5% return , Fred will still make a bundle.  Specifically –  with Stagn ant’s p/e ratio 
remaining unc hange d at ten – Fre d’s option will deliv er him $63 m illion.  Meanwh ile, his share holders will 
wonder what happened to the “alignment of interests” that was s uppose d to occur when Fred was  issued 
options. 
 
 A “n ormal” divi dend policy, of co urse – one-third of ear nings pai d out, for e xample – pro duces 
less ex treme resu lts bu t still can  provide lush rewards for managers who  achieve nothing. 
 
 CEOs understan d this math and kno w that ev ery dime paid out in dividends reduces th e value of 
all outstanding options.  I’ve neve r, however, seen this manager -owner conflict refe rence d in proxy 
materials that request a pproval of a  fixed-pri ced option plan.  Though CEOs invariably preac h interna lly 
that capital comes at a cost, they so mehow forget to tell share holders that fixed-price opt ions give them 
capital th at is free.  
 
 It does n’t have  to be this way : It’s chi ld’s play for a b oard to desi gn options that give effect to the 
automatic build-up in valu e that occurs when ea rnings are retaine d.  But – surprise, surprise – options of 
that kind are almost never issu ed.  Indeed, the very though t of options with strike prices th at are adj usted 
for retained earni ngs seem s forei gn to com pensation “e xperts,” who are  nevert heless ency clopedic about 
every  manage ment-frie ndly plan t hat exists.  (“Whose bre ad I eat, his song I sing.”) 
 
 Getting fired can produce a par ticularly boun tiful payday fo r a CEO .  Indeed , he can “ear n” more 
in that sin gle day, wh ile clean ing out his desk, than an American worker ea rns in a lifetim e of cle aning 
toilets.  Forget  the old m axim abou t nothi ng succee ding like success: T oday, in the e xecutive s uite, the  all-
too-prevale nt rule is th at nothing succee ds like failure . 
 
 
 16 Huge severance pay ments, lavish perks and outsized payments for ho-hum perf ormance often 
occur b ecause comp committees h ave become slav es to  comparativ e data.  Th e drill is simple: Th ree o r so 
directors – not chose n by chance – are bombarded for a few hours before a b oard meeting wi th pay 
statistics th at perp etually ratch et upward s.  Additionally, t he committee i s told abou t new perks that other 
managers a re receiving.  In this manner, outlandis h “goodies” are showere d upon CEOs simply becaus e of 
a cor porate version of the argument we al l used when children: “But, Mom, all the other ki ds ha ve one.”  
When comp commi ttees fo llow th is “log ic,” yesterd ay’s m ost egre gious  excess bec omes today ’s baseline. 
 
 Comp commit tees shou ld adop t the attitu de of Hank  Greenb erg, the Detroit slu gger and  a boyhood 
hero of mine.  Hank’s son, Steve, at one time was a player’s a gent.  Repr esenting an outfielder in 
negotiations with a major league cl ub, Steve sou nded out his dad about the size of t he signing bonus he 
should ask f or.  Hank , a true pay-for-performance guy , got straight to the point, “What did he hit last year?”  
When Steve answered “.246,” Hank’s comeback was imm ediate: “As k for a uniform .” 
 
 (Let me pause for a brief con fession: In criticizin g comp commit tee behavior, I do n’t speak as a 
true insider.  Though I have served as a director of twenty public companies, only one CEO has put me on 
his comp commit tee.  Hmmmm .  . .) 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 My views  on America’s long-term  problem in resp ect to trade imbalances, which I have laid ou t in 
previous reports, rem ain unchange d.  My conviction, however, cost Berkshire $955 million pre-tax in 2005.  
That amount is included in our earni ngs statement, a fact  that illustrates the differing ways in which GAAP 
treats g ains and  losses.  When we have a lo ng-term position in stocks or bond s, year- to-year changes in  
value a re reflected in our bal ance s heet but, as long as the asset is not s old, are rarely re flected in ea rnings.  
For example, our Coca-Co la holdings wen t from $1 billion  in value early o n to $13.4 billion at yearen d 
1998 and have since declin ed to  $8.1 billion – with  none of th ese m oves affecting  our earn ings statemen t.  
Long-term  currency positions, however, are d aily m arked to m arket an d therefo re hav e an effect on 
earni ngs i n every reporting period.  From the dat e we fi rst entered into currency contracts, we are  $2.0 
billion in th e black. 
 
 We re duced our direct position in c urrencies so mewhat during 200 5.  We p artially o ffset th is 
change, however, by purchasing equities who se prices are denominated in a variety of foreign  currencies 
and that earn a large part of their profits internationally.  Charlie and I prefer this method of acquiring non-
dollar exposure.  T hat’s largely because  of cha nges in interest rates: As U.S. rates ha ve risen relative to 
those of the rest of the world, holding most foreign currencies now involves a si gnificant negative “ca rry.”  
The ca rry aspect of our direct currency position indee d cost us m oney  in 2005 and is likely to do so again in 
2006.  In contrast, th e ownership of fo reign equities is lik ely, o ver time, to create a p ositive carry – perhaps 
a sub stantial one. 
 
 The underlying factors affecting the U.S. c urrent account deficit continue to worse n, and no letup 
is in sight.  Not only did our trade deficit – the large st and most familiar item in the current account – hit an 
all-time high in 2005, but we also can e xpect a secon d item – the bal ance of i nvestment income – to soon 
turn negative.  As f oreigners increase t heir ownership of U.S. assets (or of claim s against us) relative to  
U.S. inv estments abro ad, these in vestors will b egin earning more on their ho ldings than we do  on ours.  
Finally, th e third co mponent of the current acco unt, unilateral transfers, is always negative.   
 
 The U.S., it sho uld be emphasized , is ex traord inarily rich an d will g et richer.  As a resu lt, the huge 
imbalances in its curre nt account m ay continue for a long time without their ha ving noticeable deleterious  
effects on the U.S. eco nomy or on markets.  I doubt, however, that the situation will forev er rem ain benign.  
Either Am erican s add ress the p roblem soon in a way we select, o r at so me point the problem will likely 
address us in an unpleasant way of its own.  
 
 
 
 
 
 17How to Mini mize Investme nt Returns 
 
 It’s b een an easy matter for Berk shire an d other own ers of Am erican  equities to  prosper ov er the 
years.  Bet ween Decem ber 31, 1899 a nd Dece mber 31, 1999, to give a really lo ng-term  example, the Dow 
rose from 66 to 11,497.  (Guess wh at annual g rowth rate is requ ired to produce this resu lt; th e surpri sing 
answ er is at the end of this sect ion.)  This huge rise ca me about  for a simple reason:  Over the century 
American busi nesses di d ext raordinarily well and i nvest ors rode the wav e of their prosperity.  Businesses 
continue to do well.  Bu t now sh areho lders, th rough a series o f self-in flicted wounds, are in  a major way  
cutting the return s they will realize fro m their inv estments. 
 
 The exp lanation of how th is is h appening b egins with a fu ndamental tru th: With  unimportant 
exceptions , such as ba nkruptcies in whic h some of a com pany’s los ses are  borne by cre ditors, the most that 
owners in aggregate can earn between now and Judgment Day is what their businesse s in aggregate earn. 
True , by buying and selling that is clever or lucky, investor A m ay take m ore than his share of the pie at the  
expe nse of investor B.  And, yes, all invest ors feel richer when st ocks soa r.  But an owner can exit only by 
having someone take hi s place.  If one investor sel ls high, another m ust buy high.  For owners as a whole, 
there is sim ply no m agic – no showe r of m oney from  outer space – that will enable  them to extract wealth 
from  their companies  beyond that cr eated by the com panies them selves. 
 
 Indee d, owners must earn les s than their businesse s earn because of “fric tiona l” costs.  And that’s  
my point: These costs are now being inc urred in  amounts that will cause share holders t o earn far less th an 
they historically h ave. 
 
 To understand h ow this toll has ballooned, imagine for a moment that all Am erican  corporation s 
are, and  always will b e, owned by a sin gle fam ily.  We’ll call th em the Gotrocks.  After p aying taxes on 
dividends, this family – ge neration after generation – becomes richer by the aggregate amount earned by its 
companies.  Today  that am ount is about $700 billion a nnually.  Naturally, the  family spends s ome of these 
dollars.  B ut the portio n it sav es stead ily co mpounds for its benefit.  In  the Go trocks ho usehold everyone 
grows wealthier at the  same pace, and all is harm onious. 
 
 But let’s now assum e that a  few fast-talki ng Help ers approach the fam ily and persuade each of its 
members to  try to outsmart his relativ es by buying certa in of th eir holdings and  sellin g them certain  others. 
The Help ers – for a fee, of cou rse – ob ligingly ag ree to handle these tran sactio ns.  Th e Gotrocks still o wn 
all of c orporat e Am erica; the trades  just rearrange who ow ns w hat.  So the fam ily’s annual gain in wealth 
diminishes, e qualing the earnings of Am erican busi ness minus commissions paid.  The more that family 
members trade , the sm aller their sha re of the  pie a nd the larger t he slice received by  the Helpers.  This fact 
is no t lost upon th ese broker-Helpers: Activity is th eir friend and, in a wide variety o f ways, th ey urge it on . 
 
 After a while, most of the family members realize that the y are not doing so  well at th is new “b eat-
my-brot her” game.  Ent er another set of Helpers.  These newcomers explain t o each m ember of the 
Gotrocks clan that by himself he’ll neve r outsmart the rest of the fam ily.  The suggested cure: “Hire a 
manager – yes, us – an d get  the job done professionally.”  Th ese manager-Hel pers co ntinue to use th e 
broker-Hel pers to execute tra des; th e managers m ay even increase thei r activity so  as to  permit the brokers 
to prosper still m ore.  Ov erall, a b igger slice of the pie now goes to th e two classes of Helpers. 
 
 The family’s disappointment grows.  Each of its members is now em ploying professionals.  Yet 
overall, the group’s finances have taken a turn for the worse.  Th e solution?   More help, of co urse. 
 
 It arri ves in the form  of financial p lanners and  institutional consultants, who weigh  in to advise the 
Gotrocks on selecting m anager -Helpers.  The be fuddled fam ily wel comes this assi stance.  B y now its 
members know they ca n pick neither the right stocks nor the right stock-pickers.  Why , one might ask, 
should they ex pect su ccess in picking the righ t con sultant?  But this question does no t occur to the 
Gotrocks, and the consultant-Helpers certainly don’t suggest it to them. 
 
 
 18 The Gotrocks, now supporting three cl asses of expensive Help ers, fi nd that their results get worse, 
and they si nk into despair.  B ut just a s hope  seem s lost, a fo urth group  – we’ll call th em the hyper-Hel pers 
– appea rs.  T hese friendly fol k explain t o the Gotrocks that their unsatisfactory re sults are occurrin g 
because the existing Helpers – brokers , managers , consultants – are not s ufficiently motivated and a re 
simply going through the motions.  “ What,” the new Helpers as k, “ca n you ex pect from such a b unch of 
zombies?” 
 
 The new arri vals offer a breath takingly simple so lution: Pay more  money .  Brimmin g with self-
confide nce, the hyper-Hel pers assert that huge c ontinge nt paym ents – in addition to s tiff fixed fees – are  
what  each family member must fork over in order to really outmaneuve r his relatives. 
 
 The more observant members of the family see that some o f the hyper-Help ers are really ju st 
manager -Helpers weari ng n ew uni forms, beari ng sewn-on sexy nam es like HEDGE FUND  or PRIVAT E 
EQUI TY.  The new Helpers, however, assure the Gotrocks that this change of clothing is all-important, 
bestowing on its weare rs magical powers si milar to those acqui red by mild-mannere d Clark Kent  when he 
chan ged into his Superm an costume.  Calmed by this explanation, the family deci des to pay up. 
 
 And that’s where we are today: A rec ord portion of the earnings that would go in their entirety to 
owners – if they all j ust stayed  in their rocking chairs – is no w going to a swelling  arm y of Helpers.  
Particularly expensive is the recen t pandemic of profit arrangem ents under whic h Helpers receive large 
portion s of the winn ings when they are sm art or lu cky, and  leav e fam ily members with  all o f the losses –  
and large fi xed fees t o boot – when the Helper s are dum b or unl ucky (o r occasionally crooke d). 
 
 A su fficien t number of arran gements like this – heads, the Help er tak es much of the winn ings; 
tails, the Gotrocks lose a nd pay dear ly for the privilege of doi ng so – may make it more accurate to cal l the 
family the Ha drocks.  Today, in fact, the family’s fri ctional cost s of al l sorts may well amount to 20% of 
the earnings of Am erican business.  In ot her words, the burden of paying Helpe rs may cause Am erican 
equity in vestors, ov erall, t o earn  only 80% or so  of what they wou ld earn  if they just sat still an d listen ed to 
no one. 
 
 Long a go, Sir Isaac Newt on gave us t hree la ws of motion, whic h we re the  work of genius.  But Sir

calculate the movem ent of the stars, but not the madness  of men.”  If  he had not been traumatized b y this 
loss, Sir Isaac might well have gone on to  discover the Four th La w of Motion : For i nvestors as a whole, 
returns  decrease as  motion increa ses.

 Here ’s the ans wer to the question posed at the begi nning of this section: To get  very  specific, the 
Dow increase d from 65.73 to 11,497.12 in the 20th cent ury, and that amounts to a gain of 5.3% 
compounde d annually.  (Inve stors woul d also have receive d dividends, of course.)  T o achieve a n equal rate  
of gain in the 21st century, t he Dow will ha ve to rise by Dece mber 31, 2099 to – brace yourself – precisely 
2,011,011.23.  Bu t I’m  willing to settle fo r 2,00 0,000 ; six years in to this cen tury, th e Dow h as gained not at 
all. 
 
Debt and Risk  
 
 As we c onsolidate MidAm erican, o ur new balance s heet may suggest  that Berkshi re has expa nded 
its tolerance for borrowing.  But that’s not so.  Exce pt for token am ounts, we shun debt, turning to it for 
only three purposes:  
 
1) We occasional ly use re pos a s a part of ce rtain s hort-term  investing st rategies that incorporate 
ownership of U.S. governmen t (or ag ency) secu rities.  Pu rchases o f this kind are highly 
opportunistic and i nvolve only the most liquid of sec urities.  A f ew years ag o, we e ntered i nto 
several interest ing transactio ns th at have since been unwound or are runn ing off.  The offsettin g 
debt has likewise bee n cut substantially and before long may be gone. 
 192) We borrow money agai nst portfolio s of interest-bearing receivables whose risk cha racteristics we 
understand .  We did this in 2001 when we gu aranteed $5.6 billion  of bank debt to take over, in 
partnership wit h Leuca dia, a bankr upt Finova (which held a broa d range  of receiva bles).  All of 
that debt  has been repaid.  More rece ntly, we ha ve b orrowed to finance a wi dely-diversified, 
predictably-perform ing portfolio of m anufact ured-home receiva bles managed by Clayton.  
Alternatively, we c ould “ securitize” – that  is, sell – these  receiva bles, but re tain the  servicing of 
them.  If we fo llowed this pro cedure, which is co mmon in the industry, we wou ld not show th e 
debt that we do on our balance sheet, a nd we would als o accelerate the earni ngs we report.  In the  
end, however, we w ould earn less m oney .  Were market variables t o change s o as to fa vor 
securitizatio n (an  unlikely ev ent), we cou ld sell p art of our portfolio and eliminate th e related  debt.  
Until then, we prefer b etter pro fits to b etter co smetics. 
 
3) At Mid American , we have substantial d ebt, but it is th at co mpany’s obligation only.  Tho ugh it 
will appear on  our consolidated balance sh eet, Berk shire does not guarantee it. 
 
Even so, this debt is unquestionabl y secure beca use i t is serviced by MidAm erican’s diversified 
stream  of highly-stab le utility  earn ings.  If t here were to  be so me bolt fro m the blue that hurt one 
of MidAmerican ’s utility p roperties, earn ings from the others wo uld still b e more th an am ple to 
cove r all debt requirements.  M oreover, MidAm erican  retain s all of its earn ings, an  equity-
building practice th at is rare i n the utility field . 
 
 From a risk  standpoint, it is far safer to  have earn ings from ten diverse an d uncorrelated  utility  
operations that cove r interest char ges by, say, a 2: 1 ratio than it is to have fa r greater cove rage 
provided by a single utility.  A catastrop hic event can  render a si ngle utility insolvent – witness 
what Kat rina did  to the local electric u tility in New Orleans –  no matter h ow conservative its d ebt 
policy.  A ge ographical disaster – say , an e arthquake in a West ern state – can’t  have the sam e 
effect on MidAm erican.  And e ven a worrier lik e Ch arlie can ’t think of an event that wou ld 
syste mically decrease utility ear nings in any major way.  Because of MidAm erican’s e ver-
wide ning dive rsity of regulated earnings, it will always uti lize major am ounts  of debt. 
 
 And that’s abo ut it.  We are no t interested  in incurring an y significan t debt at Berk shire for 
acquisition s or operating  purposes.  Conv entional business wisd om, of cou rse, would argu e that we are 
being too conservat ive and that there are a dded profits that coul d be sa fely earned i f we injected m oderate 
leverage into our balance sh eet. 
 
 Maybe so.  B ut many of B erkshire’s hundreds of thousands of investors have a l arge portion of 
their net  worth in our st ock (among t hem, it shoul d be em phasized, a l arge number of ou r board and key  
managers ) and a disaster for the com pany would be a disaster for them .  Moreove r, there are pe ople who 
have been permanent ly injured to whom we o we insurance pay ments that stretch out for fi fty years or 
more.  To  these an d other con stituencies we h ave promised total secu rity, wh atever co mes: fin ancial panics, 
stock-exc hange closures (a n extended one occurre d in 1914) or even dom estic nuclear, chem ical or 
biological attacks. 
 
 We a re quite willing to acce pt huge  risks.  Indeed , more tha n any other insure r, we write high-lim it 
policies th at are tied  to sing le catastrop hic events.  We also  own  a larg e investment portfolio whose mark et 
value cou ld fall d ramatically and quickly under certain  conditions (as h appened on Octob er 19, 1987).  
Whatever occurs, tho ugh, Berkshire will h ave the net worth, th e earn ings stream s and the liq uidity to  
handle the prob lem with  ease. 
 
 Any other a pproach i s dangerous.  Over the years, a n umber of very smart peo ple have learne d the 
hard way th at a long string of im pressiv e numbers m ultiplied by a single zero always eq uals zero .  That is 
not an equation whose ef fects I wo uld like to experience pers onally, and I would like eve n less to be 
respon sible for imposing its penalties up on others. 
 
 
 
 20Manageme nt Succession 
 
 As owners, you are naturally concerned about whether I will in sist on  continuing as C EO after I 
begin to fade and, if so , how the board will han dle that  problem.  Yo u also wan t to know what happens if I 
should die tonight. 
 
 That second question is eas y to answer.  Most of our many busi nesses ha ve st rong m arket 
positions, sign ifican t momentum, and terrifi c managers.  The special Berk shire culture is deeply ingrained 
throughout our sub sidiaries, an d these op erations won’t m iss a beat whe n I die. 
 
 Moreover, we have  three m anage rs at Berkshire wh o are reason ably young and fully capable  of 
being CEO.  Any of the three w ould be much better at certain manage ment aspect s of my job t han I.  On 
the minus si de, none has m y cross over e xperience t hat allows m e to be comfortable making deci sions in 
either th e business aren a or in investments.  Th at problem will b e solved by having anoth er person in the 
organizatio n handle marketable securities.  Th at’s an  interestin g job at Berk shire, and th e new CEO wil l 
have  no problem in hiring a talented individual to do it.  Indeed , that’s what we have done at GEICO for 26 
years, and our resu lts have been terrific. 
 
 Berkshire’s board has fully discuss ed eac h of t he three CEO can didates and has unanimously 
agree d on the person who s hould succeed me if a repl acement were needed toda y.  The directors stay 
updated on this subject  and could alter their view as ci rcumstances cha nge – new m anage rial stars may 
emerge and presen t ones will ag e.  Th e important point is th at the directors know now –  and will always  
know in th e future – ex actly wh at they will do  when the need arises. 
 
 The other questio n that must be addressed  is wh ether the Board will b e prepared to make a ch ange 
if that need should arise not from my death but rathe r from  my decay, particularly  if this decay is  
accom panied by my delusionally thi nking that I am  reac hing ne w peaks of m anage rial brilliance.  That 
problem woul d not be uni que to me.  Charl ie and I have faced  this situ ation from t ime to time at 
Berks hire’s subsidiaries .  Humans age at greatly varyi ng rates – b ut sooner or later their talents and vigor 
declin e.  Some managers remain  effectiv e well in to their 80s – Charlie is a wo nder at 82 – and others 
noticeably fade in their 60s.  When their abilities ebb, so usually do their powers of self-assessm ent.  
Someone el se often needs  to blow the whistle. 
 
 When that time co mes for me, o ur board will h ave to step up to the job.  From a financial 
standpoint, its members are un usually m otivated to do so.  I kno w of no other board in the coun try in  which 
the financial interests of directors are s o completely aligned wi th those of shareholders.  Few b oards even 
come close.  On a personal level, howe ver, it is e xtraordinarily d ifficu lt for most people to  tell so meone, 
particularly a fr iend, that he or she is no longer  capable. 
 
 If I become a candidate fo r that message, however, ou r board will be d oing me a favo r by 
delivering it.  Every  share of Berk shire th at I own  is destined  to go to philanthropies, and I want s ociety to 
reap t he maximum good from these gi fts and bequests.  It woul d be a t ragedy  if the philanthropic potential 
of my holdings was d iminished because my asso ciates  shirked their respo nsibility t o (tend erly, I hope) 
show m e the door.  B ut don’t worry ab out this.  We have an outstan ding group of directo rs, an d they will 
alway s do what’s right for shareholders. 
 
 And while we are on the s ubject, I feel terrific. 
 
The Annual Meeting  
 
 Our m eeting this year will b e on Saturd ay, May 6 .  As always, th e doo rs will o pen at th e Qwest 
Center at 7  a.m., and the latest Berk shire movie will b e shown at 8:30.  At 9 :30 we will g o directly to  the 
question-and-an swer p eriod, which (with  a break for lunch at th e Qwest ’s stan ds) will last u ntil 3:00.  Then, 
after a sho rt recess, Ch arlie an d I will co nvene the annu al meetin g at 3:15.  Th is sch edule wo rked well las t 
year, because  it let those who wante d to attend the  form al session to do so, while freeing others to shop . 
 
 21 You certain ly did your share in  this resp ect last year.  Th e 194,300 square fo ot hall adjo ining the 
meetin g area was filled  with th e products of Berksh ire subsidiaries, and  the 21,000 people wh o cam e to the 
meetin g allowed every locatio n to rack up sales record s.  Kelly Bro z (neé Mu chemore), th e Flo Zieg feld of 
Berks hire, orc hestrates both this magnificent shopping extravaga nza and the m eeting itself.  T he exhi bitors 
love her, and so do I.  Kelly got married in October, and I gave her away.  She asked me how I wanted to 
be listed in the wedding program.  I replied “envious of the groom,” and t hat’s the way it went  to press. 
 
 This year we will showcase two Clayto n ho mes (featuring  Acm e brick, Shaw carpet, John s 
Manville in sulation, MiTek  fasten ers, Carefree awnings and NFM furnitu re).  You will find that these  
homes, pri ced at $79,000 and $89,000, deliver excel lent value.  In fact, three sha reholders cam e so fi rmly 
to that con clusion last year that th ey bought the $119,000 model we t hen showcased.  Flanking the Cl ayton 
homes on  the exhibition floor will b e RVs from Forest River. 
 
 GEIC O will h ave a boo th staffed  by a nu mber of its to p counselors from around the coun try, all of 
them read y to supply you  with auto insuran ce quotes.  In m ost cases, GEICO will b e able to give yo u a 
special shareholder discount (us ually 8%).  This sp ecial offer is perm itted by 45 of the 50 jurisdictions in 
which we operate.  (On e supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you  qualify fo r ano ther, such as 
that given cert ain groups.)  Bring the details of y our existing insurance a nd check out whet her we ca n save 
you m oney .  For at least 50% of you, I believe we ca n.  And while you’re at it, sign up for the new GEICO 
credit ca rd.  It’s the one I now use . 
 
 On Saturd ay, at the Omaha airpo rt, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets® 
availab le for your insp ection .  Stop  by the NetJets boo th at the Qwest t o learn a bout view ing these planes.  
Come to Omaha by bus; leav e in your  new plane. 
 
 The Bookworm  bouti que at the Qwest broke all rec ords last year selling Berk shire-related books .  
An amazing 3,500 of these were Poor Charlie’s Almanack , the collected wi sdom of my part ner.  This 
mean s that a co py was so ld every 9 second s.  And for good reaso n: You will never find a book with  more 
useful ideas.  Word-of-mouth recom menda tions have ca used Charlie’s first printing of 20,500 copies to sell 
out, and we wi ll therefore have a revi sed and expa nded edition on sale at our meeting.  Among t he other 22 
titles an d DVDs av ailab le last year at t he Book worm, 4,597 cop ies were so ld for $84,746 .  Our 
share holders are a bookseller’s dream . 
 
 An attachm ent to t he proxy  material that is encl osed w ith th is report explains how you  can obtain 
the cred ential yo u will n eed for ad mission to the meeting and other events.  As fo r plane, ho tel and car 
reser vations, we have a gain signed up American Ex press (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  Carol 
Pede rsen, who handles t hese matters, doe s a terrifi c job for us each year, a nd I tha nk her for it. 
 
 At Ne braska  Furniture  Mart, located on a 77-ac re site on 72nd Street between Dodge  and Pacific, 
we will ag ain be having “Berk shire Week end” pricing .  We in itiated  this special ev ent at NFM n ine years 
ago, and sales during the “Weeken d” grew from $5.3 m illion in 1997 to $27.4 million in 2005 (up 9% f rom 
a year earlier).  I get goose bumps just thinking abou t this volume. 
 
 To obtain th e discoun t, you  must make your purchases betw een Thu rsday, May 4  and Mo nday,  
May 8  inclusive, an d also  present your m eeting cred ential.  Th e period’s sp ecial p ricing  will ev en apply to 
the products of several  prestigious m anufact urers that normally have i ronclad rules aga inst discounting but 
that, in the spirit of our shareholder week end, have  made an exce ption for y ou.  We a ppreciate their 
cooperation.  NFM  is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m . Monday through S aturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p. m. on 
Sunday .  On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., we a re having a speci al affair for shareholders 
only.  I’ll be there, eat ing barbeque, drinking Coke, and counting sales. 
 
 Borsheim ’s again will have t wo shareholde r-only eve nts.  The first will be a coc ktail reception 
from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Frid ay, May 5 .  The second , the main gala, will b e from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. o n 
Sunday, May 7.  On Saturd ay, we will b e open until 6 p.m . 
 
 22 We w ill have h uge crow ds at Bo rsheim’s th roughout the weekend.  Fo r your con venience, 
therefore, sh areholder prices will b e available fro m Monday, May 1  through Saturd ay, May 1 3.  During 
that period, just identify yoursel f as a s hareholder through your m eeting c redentials or a brokerage 
statement.   
 
 Borsheim’s op erates on a gross margin that, even before the share holders’ discount, is fully twenty 
perce ntage points below that of its major ri vals.  Last year, our sha reholder-period business increased 9% 
from 2004, which cam e on t op of a 73% gain the year before.  The store sold 5,000 Berkshire Monopoly 
games – and then ran ou t.  We’ve learn ed: Plenty will b e in stock this year. 
 
 In a ten t outside of Borsheim’s, Patrick  Wolff, twice U.S. ch ess ch ampion, will tak e on all co mers 
in groups of six – blindfolded.  Add itionally, we will h ave Bob  Hamm an and Sh aron Osberg, two of th e 
world’s top bridge e xperts, available to play with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon.  They  plan to keep 
their eyes open – but Bob never sorts his cards, eve n when playing for a national champions hip. 
 
 Gorat’s – my fav orite steak house – will again  be open exclu sively for Berk shire sh areholders on 
Sunday, May 7, and  will b e serv ing from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m.  Please re member that to come to Gorat’s o n 
that day, you must have a reservation .  To make one, call 4 02-551-3733 on April 1 (but not before).   
 
 In this schoo l year, ab out 35 university classes will co me to Omaha for sessio ns with  me.  I tak e 
almost all – in  aggregate, perhaps 2, 000 students – to lunch at Gorat’s.  And they lov e it.  To  learn  why, 
come join us on Sunday . 
 
 We will again have a special r eception from 4:00 to 5: 30 on Saturd ay afternoon for sha reholde rs 
who have come from outside of North America.  E very year our meeting dra ws many people from around 
the globe, and Charlie and I want  to be sure we pe rsonally greet  those who have come so fa r.  Last  year we 
enjoyed meeting m ore than 400 of you from many dozen s of c ountries.  Any  shareholder who comes from 
other than the U.S. or Canada will b e given a special cred ential an d instructio ns for attend ing this function. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 Charlie and  I are ex traord inarily lu cky.  We we re born in America; had  terrific parents who saw  
that we go t goo d educatio ns; h ave enjoyed wond erful families an d great h ealth ; and  came eq uipped with a 
“business” gene that allows us t o prosper in a m anner hugely disproportionate to other people who 
contribute as much or m ore to our society’s well-being.   Moreover, we have l ong had jobs that we l ove, in 
which we are helped every day in  countless ways b y talented and chee rful associ ates.  No wonder we  tap-
dance t o work.  But nothing is more fu n for us than getting together with our shareholder-partners at 
Berk shire’s annual meetin g.  So join us on May 6th at the Qwest fo r our annual Wood stock for Capitalists.   
We’ll see y ou there.

 Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companie s to value the equity securities they hold at market rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was prev iously the requirement.  In this table, Berkshire’s results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rule s.  In all other respects, the results are calculated using the numbers originally reported. 
The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax.  If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appr opriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return.  Over the years, the tax cost s would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.
  
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. 
 
 
To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: 
 
Our gain in net worth during 2006 was $16.9 billion, which increased the per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stock by 18.4%.  Over the last 42 years (that is, since present management took over) book value has grown from $19 to $7 0,281, a rate of 21.4% compounded annually.* 
 
We believe that $16.9 billion is a record for a one-year gain in net worth – more than has ever been booked by any American business, leaving aside boosts that have occurred because of mergers (e.g., AOL’s purchase of Time Warner).  Of course, Exxon Mobil and other companies earn far more than Berkshire, but their earnings largely go to dividends and/or repurchases, rather than to building net worth. 
 
All that said, a confession about our 2006 gain is in order.  Our most important business, insurance, benefited from a large dose of luck:  Mother Nature, bless her heart, went on vacation.  After hammering us with hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 – storms that caused us to lose a bundle on super-cat insurance – she just vanished.  Last year, the red ink from this activity turned black – very black. 
 
In addition, the great majority of our 73 businesses did outstandingly well in 2006.  Let me focus for a moment on one of our largest operations, GEICO.   What management accomplished there was simply extraordinary. 
 
As I’ve told you before, Tony Nicely, GEICO’s CEO,  went to work at the company 45 years ago, two months after turning 18.  He became CEO in 1992, and from then on the company’s growth exploded.  In addition, Tony has delivered staggering productivity  gains in recent years.  Between yearend 2003 and yearend 2006, the number of GEICO policies increased from 5.7 million to 8.1 million, a jump of 42%.  Yet during that same period, the company’s employees (measured on a fulltime-equivalent basis) fell 3.5%.  So productivity grew 47%.  And GEICO didn’t start fat. 
 
That remarkable gain has allowed GEICO to maintain its all-important position as a low-cost producer, even though it has dramatically increased advertising expenditures.  Last year GEICO spent $631 million on ads, up from $238 million in 2003 (and  up from $31 million in 1995, when Berkshire took control).  Today, GEICO spends far more on ads than any of its competitors, even those much larger.  We will continue to raise the bar. 
 
Last year I told you that if you had a new son or grandson to be sure to name him Tony.  But Don Keough, a Berkshire director, recently had a better idea.  After reviewing GEICO’s performance in 2006, he wrote me, “Forget births.  Tell the shareholders to immediately change the names of their present children to Tony or Antoinette.”  Don signed his letter “Tony.”

Charlie Munger – my partner and Berkshire’s vice chairman – and I run what has turned out to be a big business, one with 217,000 employees and annual revenues approaching $100 billion.  We certainly didn’t plan it that way.  Charlie began as a lawyer, and I thought of myself as a security analyst.  Sitting in those seats, we both grew skeptical about the ability of big entities of any type to function well.  Size seems to make many organizations slow-thinking, resistant to change and smug.  In Churchill’s words: “We shape our buildings, and afterwards our buildings shape us.”  Here’s a telling fact: Of the ten non-oil companies having the largest market capitalization in 1965 – titans such as General Motors, Sears, DuPont and Eastman Kodak – only one made the 2006 list.   
 
  
 *All per-share figures used in this report apply to  Berkshire’s A shares.  Figures for the B shares are 1/30
th of those shown for the A. 
 3In fairness, we’ve seen plenty of successes as well, some truly outstanding.  There are many giant-company managers whom I greatly admire; Ken Chenau lt of American Express, Jeff Immelt of G.E. and Dick Kovacevich of Wells Fargo come quickly to mind.   But I don’t think I could do the management job they do.  And I know I wouldn’t enjoy many of the duties that come with their positions – meetings, speeches, foreign travel, the charity circuit and governmental relations.  For me, Ronald Reagan had it right: “It’s probably true that hard work never killed anyone – but why take the chance?” 
 
So I’ve taken the easy route, just sitting back and working through great managers who run their own shows.  My only tasks are to cheer them on, sculpt and harden our corporate culture, and make major capital-allocation decisions.  Our managers have returned this trust by working hard and effectively. 
 
For their performance over the last 42 years – and particularly for 2006 – Charlie and I thank them. 
 
Yardsticks 
 
 Charlie and I measure Berkshire’s progress and eval uate its intrinsic value in a number of ways. No single criterion is effective in doing these jobs, and even an avalanche of statistics will not capture some factors that are important.  For example, it’s essential that we have managers much younger than I available to succeed me.  Berkshire has never been in better shap e in this regard – but I can’t prove it to you with numbers. 
 
 There are two statistics, however, that are of real importance.  The first is the amount of investments (including cash and cash-equivalents) that we own on a per-share basis.  Arriving at this figure, we exclude investments held in our finance operation because these are largely offset by borrowings.  Here’s the record since present management acquired control of Berkshire:

 In our early years we put most of our retained earnings and insurance float into investments in marketable securities.  Because of this emphasis, and because the securities we purchased generally did well, our growth rate in investments was for a long time quite high. 
 
 Over the years, however, we have focused more and more on the acquisition of operating businesses.  Using our funds for these purchases has bo th slowed our growth in investments and accelerated our gains in pre-tax earnings from non-insurance businesses, the second yardstick we use.  Here’s how those earnings have looked:

 *Excluding purchase-accounting adjustments and net of minority interests 
 
 Last year we had a good increase in non-insurance earnings – 38%.  Large gains from here on in, though, will come only if we are able to make major, and sensible, acquisitions.  That will not be easy.  We do, however, have one advantage: More and more, Berkshire has become “the buyer of choice” for business owners and managers.  Initially, we were view ed that way only in the U.S. (and more often than not by private companies).  We’ve long wanted, noneth eless, to extend Berkshire’s appeal beyond U.S. borders.  And last year, our globe-trotting finally got underway. 
 
Acquisitions 
 
 We began 2006 by completing the three acquisitions pending at yearend 2005, spending about $6 billion for PacifiCorp, Business Wire and Applied Underwriters.  All are performing very well. 
 
 The highlight of the year, however, was our July 5th acquisition of most of ISCAR, an Israeli company, and our new association with its chairman , Eitan Wertheimer, and CEO, Jacob Harpaz.  The story here began on October 25, 2005, when I received a 1¼-page letter from Eitan, of whom I then knew nothing.  The letter began, “I am writing to introdu ce you to ISCAR,” and proceeded to describe a cutting- tool business carried on in 61 countries.  Then Eitan wrote, “We have for some time considered the issues of generational transfer and ownership that are typical for large family enterprises, and have given much thought to ISCAR’s future.  Our conclusion is that  Berkshire Hathaway would be the ideal home for ISCAR.  We believe that ISCAR would continue to thrive as a part of your portfolio of businesses.” 
 
Overall, Eitan’s letter made the quality of the company and the character of its management leap off the page.  It also made me want to learn more, and in November, Eitan, Jacob and ISCAR’s CFO, Danny Goldman, came to Omaha.  A few hours with them convinced me that if we were to make a deal, we would be teaming up with extraordinarily talented ma nagers who could be trusted to run the business after a sale with all of the energy and dedication that they had exhibited previously.  However, having never bought a business based outside of the U.S. (though I had bought a number of foreign stocks), I needed to get educated on some tax and jurisdictional matters.  With that task completed, Berkshire purchased 80% of ISCAR for $4 billion.  The remaining 20% stays in the hands of the Wertheimer family, making it our valued partner. 
 
 ISCAR’s products are small, consumable cutting tool s that are used in conjunction with large and expensive machine tools.  It’s a business without magic except for that imparted by the people who run it.  But Eitan, Jacob and their associates are true managerial magicians who constantly develop tools that make their customers’ machines more productive.  Th e result: ISCAR makes money because it enables its customers to make more money.  There is no better recipe for continued success. 
 5 In September, Charlie and I, along with five Be rkshire associates, visited ISCAR in Israel.  We – and I mean every one of us – have never been more impressed with any operation.  At ISCAR, as throughout Israel, brains and energy are ubiquitous.  Berkshire shareholders are lucky to have joined with Eitan, Jacob, Danny and their talented associates.

 A few months later, Berkshire again became “the buyer of choice” in a deal brought to us by my friend, John Roach, of Fort Worth.  John, many of you will remember, was Chairman of Justin Industries, which we bought in 2000.  At that time John was helping John Justin, who was terminally ill, find a permanent home for his company.  John Justin died soon after we bought Justin Industries, but it has since been run exactly as we promised him it would be. 
 
 Visiting me in November, John Roach brought along Paul Andrews, Jr., owner of about 80% of TTI, a Fort Worth distributor of electronic components.  Over a 35-year period, Paul built TTI from $112,000 of sales to $1.3 billion.  He is a remarkable entrepreneur and operator. 
 
 Paul, 64, loves running his business.  But not long ago he happened to witness how disruptive the death of a founder can be both to a private company’s employees and the owner’s family.  What starts out as disruptive, furthermore, often evolves into destructive.  About a year ago, therefore, Paul began to think about selling TTI.  His goal was to put his business in the hands of an owner he had carefully chosen, rather than allowing a trust officer or lawyer to conduct an auction after his death. 
 
 Paul rejected the idea of a “strategic” buyer, knowing that in the pursuit of “synergies,” an owner of that type would be apt to dismantle what he had so carefully built, a move that would uproot hundreds of his associates (and perhaps wound TTI’s business in the process).  He also ruled out a private equity firm, which would very likely load the company with debt and then flip it as soon as possible. 
 
 That left Berkshire.  Paul and I met on the morning of November 15th and made a deal before lunch.  Later he wrote me: “After our meeting, I am c onfident that Berkshire is the right owner for TTI . . . I am proud of our past and excited about our future.”  And so are Charlie and I. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 We also made some “tuck-in” acquisitions during 2006 at Fruit of the Loom (“Fruit”), MiTek, CTB, Shaw and Clayton.  Fruit made the largest purchases.  First, it bought Russell Corp., a leading producer of athletic apparel and uniforms for about $1.2 billion (including assumed debt) and in December it agreed to buy the intimate apparel business of VF Corp.  Together, these acquisitions add about $2.2 billion to Fruit’s sales and bring with them about 23,000 employees. 
 
 Charlie and I love it when we can acquire busine sses that can be placed under managers, such as John Holland at Fruit, who have already shown their stuff at Berkshire.  MiTek, for example, has made 14 acquisitions since we purchased it in 2001, and Gene T oombs has delivered results from these deals far in excess of what he had predicted.  In effect, we leverage  the managerial talent already with us by these tuck- in deals.  We will make many more. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 We continue, however, to need “elephants” in order for us to use Berkshire’s flood of incoming cash.  Charlie and I must therefore ignore the pursuit of mice and focus our acquisition efforts on much bigger game. 
 
Our exemplar is the older man who crashed his gr ocery cart into that of a much younger fellow while both were shopping.  The elderly man explained apologetically that he had lost track of his wife and was preoccupied searching for her.  His new acquain tance said that by coincidence his wife had also wandered off and suggested that it might be more efficient if they jointly looked for the two women.  Agreeing, the older man asked his new companion what his wife looked like.  “She’s a gorgeous blonde,” the fellow answered, “with a body that would cause a bishop to go through a stained glass window, and she’s wearing tight white shorts.  How about yours?”  The senior citizen wasted no words: “Forget her, we’ll look for yours.” 
 6What we are looking for is described on page 25.  If you have an acquisition candidate that fits, call me – day or night.  And then watch me shatter a stained glass window.

 Now, let’s examine the four major operating sectors of Berkshire.  Lumping their financial figures together impedes analysis.  So we’ll look at them as four separate businesses, starting with the all– important insurance group. 
 
Insurance 
 
 Next month marks the 40th anniversary of our entrance into the insurance business.  It was on March 9, 1967, that Berkshire purchased National Indemnity and its companion company, National Fire & Marine, from Jack Ringwalt for $8.6 million. 
 
 Jack was a long-time friend of mine and an ex cellent, but somewhat eccentric, businessman.  For about ten minutes every year he would get the urge to sell his company.  But those moods – perhaps brought on by a tiff with regulators or an unfavorable jury verdict – quickly vanished. 
 
 In the mid-1960s, I asked investment banker Charlie Heider, a mutual friend of mine and Jack’s, to alert me the next time Jack was “in heat.”  When Charlie’s call came, I sped to meet Jack.  We made a deal in a few minutes, with me waiving an audit, “due diligence” or anything else that would give Jack an opportunity to reconsider.  We just shook hands, and that was that. 
 
 When we were due to close the purchase at Char lie’s office, Jack was late.  Finally arriving, he explained that he had been driving around looking for a parking meter with some unexpired time.  That was a magic moment for me.  I knew then that Jack was going to be my kind of manager. 
 
 When Berkshire purchased Jack’s two insurers, they had “float” of $17 million.  We’ve regularly offered a long explanation of float in earlier reports, which you can read on our website.  Simply put, float is money we hold that is not ours but which we get to invest. 
 
 At the end of 2006, our float had grown to $50.9 billion, and we have since written a huge retroactive reinsurance contract with Equitas – which I will describe in the next section – that boosts float by another $7 billion.  Much of the gain we’ve made has come through our acquisition of other insurers, but we’ve also had outstanding internal growth, particularly at Ajit Jain’s amazing reinsurance operation.  Naturally, I had no notion in 1967 that our float would develop as it has.  There’s much to be said for just putting one foot in front of the other every day. 
 
 The float from retroactive reinsurance contracts, of which we have many, automatically drifts down over time.  Therefore, it will be difficult for us  to increase float in the future unless we make new acquisitions in the insurance field.  Whatever its size, however, the all-important cost of Berkshire’s float over time is likely to be significantly below that of the industry, perhaps even falling to less than zero.  Note the words “over time.”  There will be bad years periodically.  You can be sure of that. 
 
 In 2006, though, everything went right in insurance – really right.  Our managers – Tony Nicely (GEICO), Ajit Jain (B-H Reinsurance), Joe Brandon and Tad Montross (General Re), Don Wurster (National Indemnity Primary), Tom Nerney (U.S. Li ability), Tim Kenesey (Medical Protective), Rod Eldred (Homestate Companies and Cypress), Sid Ferenc and Steve Menzies (Applied Underwriters), John Kizer (Central States) and Don Towle (Kansas Bankers Surety) – simply shot the lights out.  When I recite their names, I feel as if I’m at Cooperstown, reading from the Hall of Fame roster.  Of course, the overall insurance industry also had a terrific year in 2006.  But our managers delivered results generally superior to those of their competitors. 
 7 Below is the tally on our underwriting and float fo r each major sector of insurance.  Enjoy the view, because you won’t soon see another like it.

 In 2007, our results from the bread-and-butter lines of insurance will deteriorate, though I think they will remain satisfactory.  The big unknown is super- cat insurance.  Were the terrible hurricane seasons of 2004-05 aberrations?  Or were they our plan et’s first warning that the climate of the 21
st Century will differ materially from what we’ve seen in the past?  If  the answer to the second question is yes, 2006 will soon be perceived as a misleading period of calm pr eceding a series of devastating storms.  These could rock the insurance industry.  It’s naïve to think of  Katrina as anything close to a worst-case event. 
 
 Neither Ajit Jain, who manages our super-cat operation, nor I know what lies ahead.  We do know that it would be a huge mistake to bet that evolving atmospheric changes are benign in their implications for insurers. 
 
 Don’t think, however, that we have lost our taste for risk.  We remain prepared to lose $6 billion in a single event, if we have been paid appropriately for assuming that risk.  We are not willing, though, to take on even very small exposures at prices that don’t reflect our evaluation of loss probabilities.  Appropriate prices don’t guarantee profits in any given year, but inappropriate prices most certainly guarantee eventual losses.  Rates have recently fallen because a flood of capital has entered the super-cat field.  We have therefore sharply reduced our wind exposures.  Our behavior here parallels that which we employ in financial markets: Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. 
 
Lloyd’s, Equitas and Retroactive Reinsurance 
 
 Last year – we are getting now to Equitas – Berkshire agreed to enter into a huge retroactive reinsurance contract, a policy that protects an insurer against losses that have already happened, but whose cost is not yet known.  I’ll give you details of the ag reement shortly.  But let’s first take a journey through insurance history, following the route that led to our deal. 
 
 Our tale begins around 1688, when Edward Lloyd opened a small coffee house in London.  Though no Starbucks, his shop was destined to achieve worldwide fame because of the commercial activities of its clientele – shipowners, merchants and venturesome British capitalists.  As these parties sipped Edward’s brew, they began to write contracts tr ansferring the risk of a disaster at sea from the owners of ships and their cargo to the capitalists, who wagered that a given voyage would be completed without incident.  These capitalists eventually became known as “underwriters at Lloyd’s.” 
 
 Though many people believe Lloyd’s to be an insurance company, that is not the case.  It is instead a place where many member-insurers transact business, just as they did centuries ago. 
 
 Over time, the underwriters solicited passive in vestors to join in syndicates.  Additionally, the business broadened beyond marine risks into every imaginable form of insurance, including exotic coverages that spread the fame of Lloyd’s far and wide.  The underwriters left the coffee house, found grander quarters and formalized some rules of association.  And those persons who passively backed the underwriters became known as “names.” 
 8 Eventually, the names came to include many thousands of people from around the world, who joined expecting to pick up some extra change without effort or serious risk.  True, prospective names were always solemnly told that they would have unlimited and everlasting liability for the consequences of their syndicate’s underwriting – “down to the last cufflink,” as the quaint description went.  But that warning came to be viewed as perfunctory.  Three hundred years of retained cufflinks acted as a powerful sedative to the names poised to sign up. 
 
 Then came asbestos.  When its prospective costs were added to the tidal wave of environmental and product claims that surfaced in the 1980s, Lloyd’ s began to implode.  Policies written decades earlier – and largely forgotten about – were developing huge losses.  No one could intelligently estimate their total, but it was certain to be many tens of billions of dollars.  The specter of unending and unlimited losses terrified existing names and scared away prospects.  Many names opted for bankruptcy; some even chose suicide. 
 
 From these shambles, there came a desperate effort  to resuscitate Lloyd’s.  In 1996, the powers that be at the institution allotted £11.1 billion to a new company, Equitas, and made it responsible for paying all claims on policies written before 1993.  In effect, this plan pooled the misery of the many syndicates in trouble.  Of course, the money allotted could prove to be insufficient – and if that happened, the names remained liable for the shortfall. 
 
But the new plan, by concentrating all of the liabilities in one place, had the advantage of eliminating much of the costly intramural squabbling that went on among syndicates.  Moreover, the pooling allowed claims evaluation, negotiation and litigation to be handled more intelligently than had been the case previously.  Equitas embraced Ben Franklin’s thinking: “We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall hang separately.”  
 
 From the start, many people predicted Equitas would eventually fail.  But as Ajit and I reviewed the facts in the spring of 2006 – 13 years after th e last exposed policy had been written and after the payment of £11.3 billion in claims – we concluded that the patient was likely to survive.  And so we decided to offer a huge reinsurance policy to Equitas. 
 
 Because plenty of imponderables continue to exist, Berkshire could not provide Equitas, and its 27,972 names, unlimited protection.  But we said – and I’m simplifying – that if Equitas would give us $7.12 billion in cash and securities (this is the float I spoke about), we would pay all of its future claims and expenses up to $13.9 billion.  That amount was $5.7 billion above what Equitas had recently guessed its ultimate liabilities to be.  Thus the names received a huge – and almost certainly sufficient – amount of future protection against unpleasant surprises.  Indeed the protection is so large that Equitas plans a cash payment to its thousands of names, an event few of them had ever dreamed possible. 
 
 And how will Berkshire fare?  That depends on how much “known” claims will end up costing us, how many yet-to-be-presented claims will surface and what they will cost, how soon claim payments will be made and how much we earn on the cash we receive be fore it must be paid out.  Ajit and I think the odds are in our favor.  And should we be wrong, Berkshire can handle it. 
 
 Scott Moser, the CEO of Equitas, summarized th e transaction neatly: “Names wanted to sleep easy at night, and we think we’ve just bought them the world’s best mattress.”

Warning: It’s time to eat your broccoli – I am now going to talk about accounting matters.  I owe this to those Berkshire shareholders who love reading about debits and credits.  I hope both of you find this discussion helpful.  All others can skip this section; there will be no quiz. 
 
 Berkshire has done many retroactive transactions – in both number and amount a multiple of such policies entered into by any other insurer.  We are the reinsurer of choice for these coverages because the obligations that are transferred to us – for example, lifetime indemnity and medical payments to be made to injured workers – may not be fully satisfied for 50 years or more.  No other company can offer the certainty  
 9that Berkshire can, in terms of guaranteeing the full and fair settlement of these obligations.  This fact is important to the original insurer, policyholders and regulators. 
 
 The accounting procedure for retroactive transactions is neither well known nor intuitive.  The best way for shareholders to understand it, therefore, is for us to simply lay out the debits and credits.  Charlie and I would like to see this done more often.  We sometimes encounter accounting footnotes about important transactions that leave us baffled, and we go away suspicious that the reporting company wished it that way.  (For example, try comprehending trans actions “described” in the old 10-Ks of Enron, even after you know how the movie ended.) 
 
So let us summarize our accounting for the Equitas transaction.  The major debits will be to Cash and Investments, Reinsurance Recoverable, and Deferred Charges for Reinsurance Assumed (“DCRA”).  The major credit will be to Reserve for Losses and Loss  Adjustment Expense.  No profit or loss will be recorded at the inception of the transaction, but underw riting losses will thereafter be incurred annually as the DCRA asset is amortized downward.  The amount of the annual amortization charge will be primarily determined by how our end-of-the-year estimates as to the timing and amount of future loss payments compare to the estimates made at the beginning of the y ear.  Eventually, when the last claim has been paid, the DCRA account will be reduced to zero.  That day is 50 years or more away. 
 
 What’s important to remember is that retroac tive insurance contracts always produce underwriting losses for us.  Whether these losses are worth experien cing depends on whether the cash we have received produces investment income that exceeds the losses.  Recently our DCRA charges have annually delivered $300 million or so of underwriting losses, which have been more than offset by the income we have realized through use of the cash we received as a pr emium.  Absent new retroactive contracts, the amount of the annual charge would normally decline over time.  After the Equitas transaction, however, the annual DCRA cost will initially increase to about $450 million a year.  This means that our other insurance operations must generate at least that much underwriting gain for our overall float to be cost-free.  That amount is quite a hurdle but one that I believe we will clear in many, if not most, years. 
 
 Aren’t you glad that I promised you there would be no quiz?

  This motley group, which sells products ranging from lollipops to motor homes, earned a pleasing 25% on average tangible net worth last year.  It’s not eworthy also that these operations used only minor financial leverage in achieving that return.  Clearly we own some terrific businesses.  We purchased many of them, however, at large premiums to net worth – a point reflected in the goodwill item shown on the balance sheet – and that fact reduces the earnings on our average carrying value to 10.8%. 
 
 Here are a few newsworthy items about companies in this sector: 
 
• Bob Shaw, a remarkable entrepreneur who from a standing start built Shaw Industries into the country’s largest carpet producer, elected last y ear, at age 75, to retire.  To succeed him, Bob recommended Vance Bell, a 31-year veteran at Shaw, and Bob, as usual, made the right call.  Weakness in housing has caused the carpet business to slow.  Shaw, however, remains a powerhouse and a major contributor to Berkshire’s earnings.  
 
• MiTek, a manufacturer of connectors for roof trusses at the time we purchased it in 2001, is developing into a mini-conglomerate.  At the rate it is growing, in fact, “mini” may soon be inappropriate.  In purchasing MiTek for $420 million, we lent the company $200 million at 9% and bought $198 million of stock, priced at $10,000 per share.  Additionally, 55 employees bought 2,200 shares for $22 million.  Each employee paid exactly the same price that we did, in most cases borrowing money to do so. 
 
And are they ever glad they did!  Five years later, MiTek’s sales have tripled and the stock is valued at $71,699 per share.  Despite its making 14 acquisitions, at a cost of $291 million, MiTek has paid off its debt to Berkshire and holds $35 million of cash.  We celebrated the fifth anniversary of our purchase with a party in July.  I told the group that it would be embarrassing if MiTek’s stock price soared beyond that of Berkshire “A” shares.  Don’t be surprised, however, if that happens (though Charlie and I will try to make our shares a moving target). 
 
• Not all of our businesses are destined to increase profits.  When an industry’s underlying economics are crumbling, talented management may slow the rate of decline.  Eventually, though, eroding fundamentals will overwhelm managerial br illiance.  (As a wise friend told me long ago, “If you want to get a reputation as a good businessman , be sure to get into a good business.”)  And fundamentals are definitely eroding in the newspaper industry, a trend that has caused the profits of our Buffalo News to decline.  The skid will almost certainly continue. 
 
When Charlie and I were young, the newspaper business was as easy a way to make huge returns as existed in America.  As one not-too-bright publisher famously said, “I owe my fortune to two great American institutions: monopoly and nepotism.”  No paper in a one-paper city, however bad the product or however inept the management, could avoid gushing profits. 
 
The industry’s staggering returns could be simply explained.  For most of the 20th Century, newspapers were the primary source of informati on for the American public.  Whether the subject was sports, finance, or politics, newspapers reigned supreme.  Just as important, their ads were the easiest way to find job opportunities or to learn the price of groceries at your town’s supermarkets.   
 11The great majority of families therefore felt the need for a paper every day, but understandably most didn’t wish to pay for two.  Advertisers preferred the paper with the most circulation, and readers tended to want the paper with the most ad s and news pages.  This circularity led to a law of the newspaper jungle: Survival of the Fattest.  
 
Thus, when two or more papers existed in a major city (which was almost universally the case a century ago), the one that pulled ahead usually  emerged as the stand-alone winner.  After competition disappeared, the paper’s pricing power in both advertising and circulation was unleashed.  Typically, rates for both advertisers and readers would be raised annually – and the profits rolled in.  For owners this was economic heaven.  (Interestingly, though papers regularly – and often in a disapproving way – reported on the profitability of, say, the auto or steel industries, they never enlightened readers about their own Midas-like situation.  Hmmm . . .) 
 
As long ago as my 1991 letter to shareholders, I non etheless asserted that this insulated world was changing, writing that “the media businesses . . . will prove considerably less marvelous than I, the industry, or lenders thought would be the case only a few years ago.”  Some publishers took umbrage at both this remark and other warnings from me that followed.  Newspaper properties, moreover, continued to sell as if they were indestructible slot machines.  In fact, many intelligent newspaper executives who regularly chronicled and analyzed important worldwide events were either blind or indifferent to what was going on under their noses.  
 
Now, however, almost all newspaper owners reali ze that they are constantly losing ground in the battle for eyeballs.  Simply put, if cable and satellite broadcasting, as well as the internet, had come along first, newspapers as we know them probably would never have existed. 
 
In Berkshire’s world, Stan Lipsey does a te rrific job running the Buffalo News, and I am enormously proud of its editor, Margaret Sullivan.  The News’ penetration of its market is the highest among that of this country’s large newspapers.  We also do better financially than most metropolitan newspapers, even though Buffalo’s population and business trends are not good.  Nevertheless, this operation faces unrelenting pres sures that will cause profit margins to slide. 
 
True, we have the leading online news operation in Buffalo, and it will continue to attract more viewers and ads.  However, the economic potential of a newspaper internet site – given the many alternative sources of information and entertainment that are free and only a click away – is at best a small fraction of that existing in the past for a print newspaper facing no competition. 
 
For a local resident, ownership of a city’s paper, like ownership of a sports team, still produces instant prominence.  With it typically comes power a nd influence.  These are ruboffs that appeal to many people with money.  Beyond that, civic-minded, wealthy individuals may feel that local ownership will serve their community well. That’s why Peter Kiewit bought the Omaha paper more than 40 years ago. 
 
We are likely therefore to see non-economic individual buyers of newspapers emerge, just as we have seen such buyers acquire major sports franchises.  Aspiring press lords should be careful, however: There’s no rule that says a newspaper’s revenues can’t fall below its expenses and that losses can’t mushroom.  Fixed costs are high in the newspaper business, and that’s bad news when unit volume heads south.  As the importance of newspapers diminishes, moreover, the “psychic” value of possessing one will wane, whereas owning a sports franchise will likely retain its cachet. 
 
Unless we face an irreversible cash drain, we will stick with the News, just as we’ve said that we would.  (Read economic principle 11, on page 76.)   Charlie and I love newspapers – we each read five a day – and believe that a free and energetic press is a key ingredient for maintaining a great democracy.  We hope that some combination of print and online will ward off economic doomsday for newspapers, and we will work hard in Buffalo to develop a sustainable business model.  I think we will be successful.  But the da ys of lush profits from our newspaper are over. 
 12• A much improved situation is emerging at NetJets, which sells and manages fractionally-owned aircraft.  This company has never had a problem growing: Revenues from flight operations have increased 596% since our purchase in 1998.  But profits had been erratic. 
 
Our move to Europe, which began in 1996, was particularly expensive.  After five years of operation there, we had acquired only 80 customers.  And by mid-year 2006 our cumulative pre-tax loss had risen to $212 million.  But European demand has now exploded, with a net of 589 customers having been added in 2005-2006.  Under Mark Booth’s brilliant leadership, NetJets is now operating profitably in Europe, and we expect the positive trend to continue. 
 
Our U.S. operation also had a good year in 2006, which led to worldwide pre-tax earnings of $143 million at NetJets last year.  We made this profit even though we suffered a loss of $19 million in the first quarter. 
 
Credit Rich Santulli, along with Mark, for this turnaround.  Rich, like many of our managers, has no financial need to work.  But you’d never know it.  He’s absolutely tireless – monitoring operations, making sales, and traveling the globe to constantly widen the already-enormous lead that NetJets enjoys over its competitors.  Today, the value of the fleet we manage is far greater than that managed by our three largest competitors combined. 
 
There’s a reason NetJets is the runaway leader: It offers the ultimate in safety and service.  At Berkshire, and at a number of our subsidiaries, NetJ ets aircraft are an indispensable business tool.  I also have a contract for personal use with NetJets and so do members of my family and most Berkshire directors.  (None of us, I should add, gets a discount.)  Once you’ve flown NetJets, returning to commercial flights is like going back to holding hands. 
 
Regulated Utility Business 
 
 Berkshire has an 86.6% (fully diluted) interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which owns a wide variety of utility operations.  The largest of thes e are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, whose 3.7 million electric customers make it the third largest distributor of electricity in the U.K.; (2) MidAmerican Energy, which serves 706,000 electric customers, primarily in Iowa; (3) Pacific Power and Rocky Mountain Power, serving about 1.7 million electric customers in six western states; and (4) Kern River and Northern Natural pipelines, which carry about 8% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S. 
 
Our partners in ownership of MidAmerican are Walter Scott, and its two terrific managers, Dave Sokol and Greg Abel.  It’s unimportant how many votes each party has; we will make major moves only when we are unanimous in thinking them wise.  Six years of working with Dave, Greg and Walter have underscored my original belief: Berkshire couldn’t have better partners. 
 
 Somewhat incongruously, MidAmerican owns the seco nd largest real estate brokerage firm in the U.S., HomeServices of America.  This company operates through 20 locally-branded firms with 20,300 agents.  Despite HomeServices’ purchase of two oper ations last year, the company’s overall volume fell 9% to $58 billion, and profits fell 50%. 
 
 The slowdown in residential real estate activity stems in part from the weakened lending practices of recent years.  The “optional” contracts and “teaser” rates that have been popular have allowed borrowers to make payments in the early years of their mortgages that fall far short of covering normal interest costs.  Naturally, there are few defaults when virtually nothing is required of a borrower.  As a cynic has said, “A rolling loan gathers no loss.”  But payments not made add to principal, and borrowers who can’t afford normal monthly payments early on are hit later with above-normal monthly obligations.  This is the Scarlett O’Hara scenario: “I’ll think about that tomorrow.”  For many home owners, “tomorrow” has now arrived.  Consequently there is a huge overhang of offerings in several of HomeServices’ markets. 
 
 Nevertheless, we will be seeking to purchase additional brokerage operations.  A decade from now, HomeServices will almost certainly be much larger. 
 13 Here are some key figures on MidAmerican’s operations:

Finance and Financial Products 
 
 You will be happy to hear – and I’m even happier – that this will be my last discussion of the losses at Gen Re’s derivative operation.  When we star ted to wind this business down early in 2002, we had 23,218 contracts outstanding.  Now we have 197.  Our cumulative pre-tax loss from this operation totals $409 million, but only $5 million occurred in 2006.  Charlie says that if we had properly classified the $409 million on our 2001 balance sheet, it would have been labeled “Good Until Reached For.”  In any event, a Shakespearean thought – slightly modified – seems appropriate for the tombstone of this derivative business: “All’s well that ends.” 
 
 We’ve also wound up our investment in Value Capital.  So earnings or losses from these two lines of business are making their final appearance in th e table that annually appears in this section. 
 
 Clayton Homes remains an anomaly in the manufactured-housing industry, which last year recorded its lowest unit sales since 1962.  Indeed, the industry’s volume last year was only about one-third that of 1999.  Outside of Clayton, I doubt if the industry, overall, made any money in 2006. 
 
Yet Clayton earned $513 million pre-tax and paid Berkshire an additional $86 million as a fee for our obtaining the funds to finance Clayton’s $10 billi on portfolio of installment receivables.  Berkshire’s financial strength has clearly been of huge help to Clayton.  But the driving force behind the company’s success is Kevin Clayton.  Kevin knows the business forward and backward, is a rational decision-maker and a joy to work with.  Because of acquisitions, Clayton now employs 14,787 people, compared to 6,661 at the time of our purchase. 
 
 We have two leasing operations: CORT (furniture), run by Paul Arnold, and XTRA (truck trailers), run by Bill Franz.  CORT’s earnings improved  significantly last year, and XTRA’s remained at the high level attained in 2005.  We continue to look for tuck-in acquisitions to be run by Paul or Bill, and also are open to ideas for new leasing opportunities.

 We show below our common stock investments.  With two exceptions, those that had a market value of more than $700 million at the end of 2006 are itemized.  We don’t itemize the two securities referred to, which have a market value of $1.9 billion, because we continue to buy them.  I could, of course, tell you their names.  But then I would have to kill you.

 We are delighted by the 2006 business performance of virtually all of our investees.  Last year, we told you that our expectation was that these companies, in aggregate, would increase their earnings by 6% to 8% annually, a rate that would double their earnings every ten years or so.  In 2006 American Express,  
 15Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and Wells Fargo, our largest holdings, increased per-share earnings by 18%, 9%, 8% and 11%.  These are stellar results, and we thank their CEOs.

 We’ve come close to eliminating our direct foreign-exchange position, from which we realized about $186 million in pre-tax profits in 2006 (earnings that were included in the Finance and Financial Products table shown earlier).  That brought our total gain since inception of this position in 2002 to $2.2 billion.  Here’s a breakdown by currency: 
 
Total Gain (Loss) in Millions
    
Australian dollar $247.1 Mexican peso $106.1 
British pound 287.2 New Zealand dollar 102.6 
Canadian dollar 398.3 Singapore dollar (2.6) 
Chinese yuan (12.7) South Korean won 261.3 
Euro 839.2 Swiss franc 9.6 
Hong Kong dollar (2.5) Taiwan dollar (45.3) 
Japanese yen 1.9 Miscellaneous options 22.9 
 
 We’ve made large indirect currency profits as well, though I’ve never tallied the precise amount.  For example, in 2002-2003 we spent about $82 milli on buying – of all things – Enron bonds, some of which were denominated in Euros.  Already we’ve recei ved distributions of $179 million from these bonds, and our remaining stake is worth $173 million.  That means our overall gain is $270 million, part of which came from the appreciation of the Euro that took place after our bond purchase. 
 
 When we first began making foreign exchange pu rchases, interest-rate differentials between the U.S. and most foreign countries favored a direct curr ency position.  But that spread turned negative in 2005.  We therefore looked for other ways to gain foreign-currency exposure, such as the ownership of foreign equities or of U.S. stocks with major earning s abroad.  The currency factor, we should emphasize, is not dominant in our selection of equities, but is merely one of many considerations. 
 
 As our U.S. trade problems worsen, the probability that the dollar will weaken over time continues to be high.  I fervently believe in real trade – the more the better for both us and the world.  We had about $1.44 trillion of this honest-to-God trade in 20 06.  But the U.S. also had $.76 trillion of pseudo-trade last year – imports for which we exchanged no goods or services.  (Ponder, for a moment, how commentators would describe the situation if our imports were $.76 trillion – a full 6% of GDP – and we had no exports.)  Making these purchases that weren’t reciprocated by sales, the U.S. necessarily transferred ownership of its assets or IOUs to the rest of the world.  Like a very  wealthy but self-indulgent family, we peeled off a bit of what we owned in order to consume more than we produced. 
 
The U.S. can do a lot of this because we are an  extraordinarily rich country that has behaved responsibly in the past.  The world is therefore w illing to accept our bonds, real estate, stocks and businesses.  And we have a vast store of these to hand over. 
 
 These transfers will have consequences, however.  Already the prediction I made last year about one fall-out from our spending binge has come true: The “investment income” account of our country – positive in every previous year since 1915 – turned negative in 2006.  Foreigners now earn more on their U.S. investments than we do on our investments abroad.  In effect, we’ve used up our bank account and turned to our credit card.  And, like everyone who gets in hock, the U.S. will now experience “reverse compounding” as we pay ever-increasing amounts of interest on interest. 
 
 I want to emphasize that even though our course is unwise, Americans will live better ten or twenty years from now than they do today.  Per-capita  wealth will increase.  But our citizens will also be forced every year to ship a significant portion of their current production abroad merely to service the cost of our huge debtor position.  It won’t be pleasant to work part of each day to pay for the over-consumption  
 16of your ancestors.  I believe that at some point in th e future U.S. workers and voters will find this annual “tribute” so onerous that there will be a severe political backlash.  How that will play out in markets is impossible to predict – but to expect a “soft landing” seems like wishful thinking.

 I should mention that all of the direct currency profits we have realized have come from forward contracts, which are derivatives, and that we have entere d into other types of derivatives contracts as well.  That may seem odd, since you know of our expensive experience in unwinding the derivatives book at Gen Re and also have heard me talk of the systemic problems that could result from the enormous growth in the use of derivatives.  Why, you may wonder, are we fooling around with such potentially toxic material? 
 
 The answer is that derivatives, just like stocks and bonds, are sometimes wildly mispriced.  For many years, accordingly, we have selectively written derivative contracts – few in number but sometimes for large dollar amounts.  We currently have 62 contracts outstanding.  I manage them personally, and they are free of counterparty credit risk.  So far, thes e derivative contracts have worked out well for us, producing pre-tax profits in the hundreds of millions of dollars (above and beyond the gains I’ve itemized from forward foreign-exchange contracts).  Though we will experience losses from time to time, we are likely to continue to earn – overall – significant profits from mispriced derivatives.

 I have told you that Berkshire has three outstanding candidates to replace me as CEO and that the Board knows exactly who should take over if I should die tonight.  Each of the three is much younger than I.  The directors believe it’s important that my successor have the prospect of a long tenure. 
 
 Frankly, we are not as well-prepared on the investment side of our business.  There’s a history here: At one time, Charlie was my potential replacemen t for investing, and more recently Lou Simpson has filled that slot.  Lou is a top-notch investor with an outstanding long-term record of managing GEICO’s equity portfolio.  But he is only six years younger than I.  If I were to die soon, he would fill in magnificently for a short period.  For the long-term, though, we need a different answer. 
 
 At our October board meeting, we discussed that subject fully.  And we emerged with a plan, which I will carry out with the help of Charlie and Lou. 
 
 Under this plan, I intend to hire a younger man or woman with the potential to manage a very large portfolio, who we hope will succeed me as Berksh ire’s chief investment officer when the need for someone to do that arises.  As part of the selection process, we may in fact take on several candidates. 
 
 Picking the right person(s) will not be an easy task .  It’s not hard, of course, to find smart people, among them individuals who have impressive investment records.  But there is far more to successful long-term investing than brains and performance that has recently been good.   
 
Over time, markets will do extraordinary, even bizarre, things.  A single, big mistake could wipe out a long string of successes.  We therefore need so meone genetically programmed to recognize and avoid serious risks, including those never before encountered.  Certain perils that lurk in investment strategies cannot be spotted by use of the models commonly employed today by financial institutions. 
 
Temperament is also important.  Independent thinking, emotional stability, and a keen understanding of both human and institutional behavior is vital to long-term investment success.  I’ve seen a lot of very smart people who have lacked these virtues. 
 
 Finally, we have a special problem to consider: our ability to keep the person we hire.  Being able to list Berkshire on a resume would materially enhance the marketability of an investment manager.  We will need, therefore, to be sure we can retain our choi ce, even though he or she could leave and make much more money elsewhere. 
 17There are surely people who fit what we need, but they may be hard to identify.  In 1979, Jack Byrne and I felt we had found such a person in Lou Simpson.  We then made an arrangement with him whereby he would be paid well for sustained overperformance.  Under this deal, he has earned large amounts.  Lou, however, could have left us long ago to manage far greater sums on more advantageous terms.  If money alone had been the object, that’s exactly what he would have done.  But Lou never considered such a move.  We need to find a younger person or two made of the same stuff.

 The good news: At 76, I feel terrific and, accordin g to all measurable indicators, am in excellent health.  It’s amazing what Cherry Coke and hamburgers will do for a fellow. 
 
Some Changes on Berkshire’s Board 
 
 The composition of our board will change in two ways this spring.  One change will involve the Chace family, which has been connected to Berkshir e and its predecessor companies for more than a century.  In 1929, the first Malcolm G. Chace played  an important role in merging four New England textile operations into Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates.  That company merged with Hathaway Manufacturing in 1955 to form Berkshire Hathaway, and Malcolm G. Chace, Jr. became its chairman. 
 
 Early in 1965, Malcolm arranged for Buffett Partnership Ltd. to buy a key block of Berkshire shares and welcomed us as the new controlling shareholder of the company.  Malcolm continued as non-executive chairman until 1969.  He was both a wonderful gentleman and helpful partner. 
 
 That description also fits his son, Malcolm “K im” Chace, who succeeded his father on Berkshire’s board in 1992.  But last year Kim, now actively and successfully running a community bank that he founded in 1996, suggested that we find a younger person to replace him on our board.  We have done so, and Kim will step down as a director at the annual m eeting.  I owe much to the Chaces and wish to thank Kim for his many years of service to Berkshire. 
 
 In selecting a new director, we were guided by our long-standing criteria, which are that board members be owner-oriented, business-savvy, interested and truly independent.  I say “truly” because many directors who are now deemed independent by various authorities and observers are far from that, relying heavily as they do on directors’ fees to maintain their standard of living.  These payments, which come in many forms, often range between $150,000 and $250,000 annually, compensation that may approach or even exceed all other income of the “independent” director.  And – surprise, surprise – director compensation has soared in recent years, pushed up by recommendations from corporate America’s favorite consultant, Ratchet, Ratchet and Bingo.  (The name may be phony, but the action it conveys is not.) 
 
Charlie and I believe our four criteria are essential if  directors are to do their job – which, by law, is to faithfully represent owners.  Yet these criteria are usually ignored.  Instead, consultants and CEOs seeking board candidates will often say, “We’re looking  for a woman,” or “a Hispanic,” or “someone from abroad,” or what have you.  It sometimes sounds as if the mission is to stock Noah’s ark.  Over the years I’ve been queried many times about potential directors and have yet to hear anyone ask, “Does he think like an intelligent owner?”   
 
 The questions I instead get would sound ridiculous to someone seeking candidates for, say, a football team, or an arbitration panel or a military co mmand.  In those cases, the selectors would look for people who had the specific talents and attitudes that were  required for a specialized job.  At Berkshire, we are in the specialized activity of running a business well, and therefore we seek business judgment. 
 
 That’s exactly what we’ve found in Susan Decker , CFO of Yahoo!, who will join our board at the annual meeting.  We are lucky to have her: She scores very high on our four criteria and additionally, at 44, is young – an attribute, as you may have noticed, that your Chairman has long lacked.  We will seek more young directors in the future, but never by slighting the four qualities that we insist upon. 
 18This and That 
 
 Berkshire will pay about $4.4 billion in federal inco me tax on its 2006 earnings.  In its last fiscal year the U.S. Government spent $2.6 trillion, or about $7 billion per day.  Thus, for more than half of one day, Berkshire picked up the tab for all federal expenditures, ranging from Social Security and Medicare payments to the cost of our armed services.  Had there been only 600 taxpayers like Berkshire, no one else in America would have needed to pay any federal income or payroll taxes. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 Our federal return last year, we should add, ran to 9,386 pages.  To handle this filing, state and foreign tax returns, a myriad of SEC requirements, and all of the other matters involved in running Berkshire, we have gone all the way up to 19 employees at World Headquarters. 
 
 This crew occupies 9,708 square feet of space, and Charlie – at World Headquarters West in Los Angeles – uses another 655 square feet.  Our home-office payroll, including benefits and counting both locations, totaled $3,531,978 last year.  We’re careful when spending your money. 
 
 Corporate bigwigs often complain about govern ment spending, criticizing bureaucrats who they say spend taxpayers’ money differently from how they  would if it were their own.  But sometimes the financial behavior of executives will also vary based on whose wallet is getting depleted.  Here’s an illustrative tale from my days at Salomon.  In the 1980s the company had a barber, Jimmy by name, who came in weekly to give free haircuts to the top brass.  A manicurist was also on tap.  Then, because of a cost-cutting drive, patrons were told to pay their own way.  One top executive (not the CEO) who had previously visited Jimmy weekly went immediately to a once-every-three-weeks schedule. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
Every now and then Charlie and I catch on early to a tide-like trend, one brimming over with commercial promise.  For example, though American Airlines (with its “miles”) and American Express (with credit card points) are credited as being trailblazers in granting customers “rewards,” Charlie and I were far ahead of them in spotting the appeal of this powerful idea.  Excited by our insight, the two of us jumped into the reward business way back in 1970 by buying control of a trading stamp operation, Blue Chip Stamps.  In that year, Blue Chip had sales of $126 million, and its stamps papered California. 
 
In 1970, indeed, about 60 billion of our stamps were licked by savers, pasted into books, and taken to Blue Chip redemption stores.  Our catalog of rewards was 116 pages thick and chock full of tantalizing items.  When I was told that even certain brothels and mortuaries gave stamps to their patrons, I felt I had finally found a sure thing. 
 
Well, not quite.  From the day Charlie and I stepped into the Blue Chip picture, the business went straight downhill.  By 1980, sales had fallen to $19.4 million.  And, by 1990, sales were bumping along at $1.5 million.  No quitter, I redoubled my managerial efforts. 
 
 Sales then fell another 98%.  Last year, in Berkshire’s $98 billion of revenues, all of $25,920 ( no zeros omitted) came from Blue Chip.  Ever hopeful, Charlie and I soldier on. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 I mentioned last year that in my service on 19 corporate boards (not counting Berkshire or other controlled companies), I have been the Typhoid Mary of compensation committees.  At only one company was I assigned to comp committee duty, and then I was promptly outvoted on the most crucial decision that we faced.  My ostracism has been peculiar, consideri ng that I certainly haven’t lacked experience in setting CEO pay.  At Berkshire, after all, I am a one-man  compensation committee who determines the salaries and incentives for the CEOs of around 40 significant operating businesses. 
 19 How much time does this aspect of my job take?  Virtually none.  How many CEOs have voluntarily left us for other jobs in our 42-year history?  Precisely none. 
 
 Berkshire employs many different incentive arrangements, with their terms depending on such elements as the economic potential or capital intensity of a CEO’s busi ness.  Whatever the compensation arrangement, though, I try to keep it both simple and fair. 
 
When we use incentives – and these can be large – they are always tied to the operating results for which a given CEO has authority.  We issue no lottery tickets that carry payoffs unrelated to business performance.  If a CEO bats .300, he gets paid for being a .300 hitter, even if circumstances outside of his control cause Berkshire to perform poorly.  And if he bats .150, he doesn’t get a payoff just because the successes of others have enabled Berkshire to prosper mightily.  An example:  We now own $61 billion of equities at Berkshire, whose value can easily rise or fall by 10% in a given year.  Why in the world should the pay of our operating executives be affected by such $6 billion swings, however important the gain or loss may be for shareholders? 
 
 You’ve read loads about CEOs who have received astronomical compensation for mediocre results.  Much less well-advertised is the fact that Am erica’s CEOs also generally live the good life.  Many, it should be emphasized, are exceptionally able, and almost all work far more than 40 hours a week.  But they are usually treated like royalty in the process.  (And we’re certainly going to keep it that way at Berkshire.  Though Charlie still favors sackcloth and as hes, I prefer to be spoiled rotten.  Berkshire owns The Pampered Chef; our wonderful office group has made me The Pampered Chief.) 
 
 CEO perks at one company are quickly copied else where.  “All the other kids have one” may seem a thought too juvenile to use as a rationale in the boardroom.  But consultants employ precisely this argument, phrased more elegantly of course, when they make recommendations to comp committees. 
 
 Irrational and excessive comp practices will not be materially changed by disclosure or by “independent” comp committee members.  Indeed, I th ink it’s likely that the reason I was rejected for service on so many comp committees was that I was regarded as too independent.  Compensation reform will only occur if the largest institutional shareh olders – it would only take a few – demand a fresh look at the whole system.  The consultants’ present drill of def tly selecting “peer” companies to compare with their clients will only perpetuate present excesses. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 Last year I arranged for the bulk of my Berkshire holdings to go to five charitable foundations, thus carrying out part of my lifelong plan to eventually use all of my shares for philanthropic purposes.  Details of the commitments I made, as well as the rationale for them, are posted on our website, 
www.berkshirehathaway.com .  Taxes, I should note, had nothing to do with my decision or its timing.  My federal and state income taxes in 2006 were exactly what they would have been had I not made my first contributions last summer, and the same point will apply to my 2007 contributions. 
 
 In my will I’ve stipulated that the proceeds from all Berkshire shares I still own at death are to be used for philanthropic purposes within ten years after my estate is closed.  Because my affairs are not complicated, it should take three years at most for this closing to occur.  Adding this 13-year period to my expected lifespan of about 12 years (though, naturally, I’m aiming for more) means that proceeds from all of my Berkshire shares will likely be distributed for societal purposes over the next 25 years or so. 
 
I’ve set this schedule because I want the money to be spent relatively promptly by people I know to be capable, vigorous and motivated.  These managerial attributes sometimes wane as institutions – particularly those that are exempt from market forces – age.  Today, there are terrific people in charge at the five foundations.  So at my death, why should they not move with dispatch to judiciously spend the money that remains? 
 20Those people favoring perpetual foundations argue that in the future there will most certainly be large and important societal problems that philanthropy will need to address.  I agree.  But there will then also be many super-rich individuals and families wh ose wealth will exceed that of today’s Americans and to whom philanthropic organizations can make their case for funding.  These funders can then judge firsthand which operations have both the vitality and the focus to best address the major societal problems that then exist.  In this way, a market test of ideas and effectiveness can be applied.  Some organizations will deserve major support while others will have outlived their usefulness.  Even if the people above ground make their decisions imperfectly, they should be able to allocate funds more rationally than a decedent six feet under will have ordained decades earlie r.  Wills, of course, can always be rewritten, but it’s very unlikely that my thinking will change in a material way. 
 
 A few shareholders have expressed concern that sales of Berkshire by the foundations receiving shares will depress the stock.  These fears are unwarra nted.  The annual trading volume of many stocks exceeds 100% of the outstanding shares, but nevertheless these stocks usually sell at prices approximating their intrinsic value.  Berkshire also tends to sell at an appropriate price, but with annual volume that is only 15% of shares outstanding.  At most, sales by the foundations receiving my shares will add three percentage points to annual trading volume, which will s till leave Berkshire with a turnover ratio that is the lowest around. 
 
Overall, Berkshire’s business performance will dete rmine the price of our stock, and most of the time it will sell in a zone of reasonableness.  It’s important that the foundations receive appropriate prices as they periodically sell Berkshire shares, but it’s also  important that incoming shareholders don’t overpay.  (See economic principle 14 on page 77.)  By both our policies and shareholder communications, Charlie and I will do our best to ensure that Berkshire sells at neither a large discount nor large premium to intrinsic value. 
 
 The existence of foundation ownership will in no way influence our board’s decisions about dividends, repurchases, or the issuance of shares.  We will follow exactly the same rule that has guided us in the past: What action will be likely to deliver the best result for shareholders over time? 
* * * * * * * * * * * * * 
 In last year’s report I allegorically described the Gotrocks family – a clan that owned all of America’s businesses and that counterproductively attempted to increase its investment returns by paying ever-greater commissions and fees to “helpers.”  Sa d to say, the “family” continued its self-destructive ways in 2006. 
 
 In part the family persists in this folly because it harbors unrealistic expectations about obtainable returns.  Sometimes these delusions are self-serving.  For example, private pension plans can temporarily overstate their earnings, and public pension plans can defer the need for increased taxes, by using investment assumptions that are likely to be out of reach.  Actuaries and auditors go along with these tactics, and it can be decades before the chickens come home to roost (at which point the CEO or public official who misled the world is apt to be gone). 
 
 Meanwhile, Wall Street’s Pied Pipers of Performa nce will have encouraged the futile hopes of the family. The hapless Gotrocks will be assured that they all can achieve above-average investment performance – but only by paying ever-higher fees.  Call this promise the adult version of Lake Woebegon. 
 
In 2006, promises and fees hit new highs.  A flood of money went from institutional investors to the 2-and-20 crowd.  For those innocent of this arrangement, let me explain: It’s a lopsided system whereby 2% of your principal is paid each year to the manager even if he accomplishes nothing – or, for that matter, loses you a bundle – and, additionally, 20% of your profit is paid to him if he succeeds, even if his success is due simply to a rising tide.  For example, a manage r who achieves a gross return of 10% in a year will keep 3.6 percentage points – two points off the top plus 20% of the residual 8 points – leaving only 6.4 percentage points for his investors.  On a $3 billi on fund, this 6.4% net “performance” will deliver the manager a cool $108 million.  He will receive this bona nza even though an index fund might have returned 15% to investors in the same period and charged them only a token fee. 
 21The inexorable math of this grotesque arrangemen t is certain to make the Gotrocks family poorer over time than it would have been had it never heard of these “hyper-helpers.”  Even so, the 2-and-20 action spreads.  Its effects bring to mind the old adage: When someone with experience proposes a deal to someone with money, too often the fellow with money ends up with the experience, and the fellow with experience ends up with the money. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 Let me end this section by telling you about one of the good guys of Wall Street, my long-time friend Walter Schloss, who last year turned 90.  From 1956 to 2002, Walter managed a remarkably successful investment partnership, from which he took not a dime unle ss his investors made money.  My admiration for Walter, it should be noted, is not based on hindsight.  A full fifty years ago, Walter was my sole recommendation to a St. Louis family who wanted an honest and able investment manager. 
 
 Walter did not go to business school, or for that matter, college.  His office contained one file cabinet in 1956; the number mushroomed to four by 2002.  Walter worked without a secretary, clerk or bookkeeper, his only associate being his son, Edwin, a graduate of the North Carolina School of the Arts.  Walter and Edwin never came within a mile of inside in formation.  Indeed, they used “outside” information only sparingly, generally selecting securities by certa in simple statistical methods Walter learned while working for Ben Graham.  When Walter and Edwin were asked in 1989 by Outstanding Investors Digest, “How would you summarize your approach?” Edwin replied, “We try to buy stocks cheap.”  So much for Modern Portfolio Theory, technical analysis, macroeconomic thoughts and complex algorithms. 
 
 Following a strategy that involved no real risk – defined as permanent loss of capital – Walter produced results over his 47 partnership years that dramatically surpassed those of the S&P 500.  It’s particularly noteworthy that he built this record by investing in about 1,000 securities, mostly of a lackluster type.  A few big winners did not account for his success.  It’s safe to say that had millions of investment managers made trades by a) drawing stock names from a hat; b) purchasing these stocks in comparable amounts when Walter made a purchase; a nd then c) selling when Walter sold his pick, the luckiest of them would not have come close to equaling his record.  There is simply no possibility that what Walter achieved over 47 years was due to chance. 
 
 I first publicly discussed Walter’s remarkable record in 1984.  At that time “efficient market theory” (EMT) was the centerpiece of investment instru ction at most major business schools.  This theory, as then most commonly taught, held that the price of any stock at any moment is not demonstrably mispriced, which means that no investor can be expected to overperform the stock market averages using only publicly-available information (though some will do so by luck).  When I talked about Walter 23 years ago, his record forcefully contradicted this dogma. 
 
And what did members of the academic community do when they were exposed to this new and important evidence?  Unfortunately, they reacted in all-too-human fashion: Rather than opening their minds, they closed their eyes.  To my knowledge no business school teaching EMT made any attempt to study Walter’s performance and what it meant for the school’s cherished theory.    
 
 Instead, the faculties of the schools went me rrily on their way presenting EMT as having the certainty of scripture.  Typically, a finance instructor who had the nerve to question EMT had about as much chance of major promotion as Galileo had of being named Pope. 
 
 Tens of thousands of students were therefore sent out into life believing that on every day the price of every stock was “right” (or, more accurately, not de monstrably wrong) and that attempts to evaluate businesses – that is, stocks – were useless.  Walter meanwhile went on overperforming, his job made easier by the misguided instructions that had been given to those young minds.  After all, if you are in the shipping business, it’s helpful to have all of your pot ential competitors be taught that the earth is flat. 
 
 Maybe it was a good thing for his investors that Walter didn’t go to college. 
 22The Annual Meeting 
 
 Our meeting this year will be held on Saturday, May 5th.   As always, the doors will open at the Qwest Center at 7 a.m., and a new Berkshire movie will be shown at 8:30.  At 9:30 we will go directly to the question-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest’s stands) will last until 3:00.  Then, after a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:15.  If you decide to leave during the day’s question periods, please do so while Charlie is talking. 
 
 The best reason to exit, of course is to shop.  We will help you do that by filling the 194,300 square foot hall that adjoins the meeting area with the products of Berkshire subsidiaries.  Last year, the 24,000 people who came to the meeting did their part, a nd almost every location racked up record sales.  But records are made to be broken, and I know you can do better. 
 
 This year we will again showcase a Clayton ho me (featuring Acme brick, Shaw carpet, Johns Manville insulation, MiTek fasteners, Carefree awning s and NFM furniture).  You will find that the home, priced at $139,900, delivers excellent value.  Last y ear, a helper at the Qwest bought one of two homes on display well before we opened the doors to shareholders.  Flanking the Clayton home on the exhibition floor this year will be an RV and pontoon boat from Forest River. 
 
 GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of them ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes.  In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a special shareholder discount (usually 8%).  This special offer is permitted by 45 of the 50 jurisdictions in which we operate.  (One supplemental point: The discount  is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that given certain groups.)  Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money.  For at least 50% of you, I believe we can.  And while you’re at it, sign up for the new GEICO credit card.  It’s the one I now use (sparingly, of course). 
 
 On Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets available for your inspection.  Stop by the NetJets booth at the Qwest to learn about viewing these planes.  Come to Omaha by bus; leave in your new plane.  And take all the hair gel that you wish on board with you. 
 
 In the Bookworm’s corner of our bazaar, there will be about 25 books and DVDs – all discounted – led again by Poor Charlie’s Almanack.  (One hapless soul last year asked Charlie what he should do if he didn’t enjoy the book.  Back came a Mungerism: “No pr oblem – just give it to someone more intelligent.”)  We’ve added a few titles this year.  Among them are Seeking Wisdom: From Darwin to Munger by Peter Bevelin, a long-time Swedish shareholder of Berkshire, and Fred Schwed’s classic, Where are the Customers’ Yachts?  This book was first published in 1940 and is now in its 4
th edition.  The funniest book ever written about investing, it lightly delivers many truly important messages on the subject. 
 
 An attachment to the proxy material that is encl osed with this report explains how you can obtain the credential you will need for admission to the meeti ng and other events.  As for plane, hotel and car reservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  Carol Pedersen, who handles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it.  Hotel rooms can be hard to find, but work with Carol and you will get one. 
 
 At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing.  We initiated this special event at NFM ten years ago, and sales during the “Weekend” grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $30 million in 2006.  I get goose bumps just thinking about this volume. 
 
 To obtain the Berkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Thursday, May 3rd and Monday, May 7
th inclusive, and also present your meeting credential.  The period’s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you.  We appreciate their cooperation.  NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m.  
 23to 6 p.m. on Sunday.  On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a special shareholder picnic featuring chicken and beef tacos (and hamburgers for traditionalists like me). 
 
 At a remodeled and expanded Borsheim’s, we will again have two shareholder-only events.  The first will be a cocktail reception from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, May 4
th.  The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 6
th, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.  On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. 
 
 We will have huge crowds at Borsheim’s throughout the weekend.  For your convenience, therefore, shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 30
th through Saturday, May 12th.  During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that shows you are a Berkshire holder. 
 
 On Sunday, in a tent outside of Borsheim’s, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, will take on all comers – who will have their eyes wide open – in groups of six.  Last year I carried on a conversation with Patrick while he pl ayed in this manner.  Nearby, Norman Beck, a remarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers.  Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the world’s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. 
 
 To add to the Sunday fun at Borsheim’s, Ariel Hsing will play table tennis (ping-pong to the uninitiated) from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. against anyone brave enough to take her on.  Ariel, though only 11, is ranked number one among girls under 16 in the U.S. (and number 1 among both boys and girls under 12).  The week I turned 75 I played Ariel, then 9 and barely tall enough to see across the table, thinking I would take it easy on her so as not to crush her young spirit.  Instead she crushed me.  I’ve since devised a plan that will give me a chance against her.  At 1 p.m. on Sunday, I will initiate play with a 2-point game against Ariel.  If I somehow win the first point, I will then fe ign injury and claim victory.  After this strenuous encounter wears Ariel down, our shareholders can then try their luck against her. 
 
 Gorat’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 6th, and will be serving from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m.  Please remember that  to come to Gorat’s on that day, you must have a reservation.  To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 1
st (but not before).   
 
 In the 2006-2007 school year, 35 university classes, including one from IBMEC in Brazil, will come to Omaha for sessions with me.  I take almost all – in aggregate, more than 2,000 students – to lunch at Gorat’s.  And they love it.  To learn why, come join us on Sunday. 
 
 We will again have a reception at 4 p.m. on Satu rday afternoon for shareholders who have come from outside of North America.  Every year our meeting draws many people from around the globe, and Charlie and I want to be sure we personally greet those who have come so far.  Last year we enjoyed meeting more than 400 of you from many dozens of countries.  Any shareholder who comes from other than the U.S. or Canada will be given a special cred ential and instructions for attending this function. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 Charlie and I are extraordinarily lucky.  We we re born in America; had terrific parents who saw that we got good educations; have enjoyed wonderful families and great health; and came equipped with a “business” gene that allows us to prosper in a manner hugely disproportionate to other people who contribute as much or more to our society’s well-being.   Moreover, we have long had jobs that we love, in which we are helped every day in countless ways by ta lented and cheerful associates.  No wonder we tap- dance to work.  But nothing is more fun for us than getting together with our shareholder-partners at Berkshire’s annual meeting.  So join us on May 5
th at the Qwest for our annual Woodstock for Capitalists.  We’ll see you there.

 Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companie s to value the equity securities they hold at market rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was prev iously the requirement.  In this table, Berkshire’s results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rule s.  In all other respects, the results are calculated using the numbers originally reported. 
The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax.  If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appr opriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return.  Over the years, the tax cost s would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.
  
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. 
 
 
To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: 
 
Our gain in net worth during 2007 was $12.3 billion, which increased the per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stock by 11%.  Over the last 43 years (that is, since present management took over) book value has grown from $19 to $78,008, a rate of 21.1% compounded annually.* 
 
Overall, our 76 operating businesses did well last y ear.  The few that had problems were primarily those linked to housing, among them our brick, carpet and real estate brokerage operations.  Their setbacks are minor and temporary.  Our competitive position in these businesses remains strong, and we have first-class CEOs who run them right, in good times or bad. 
 
Some major financial institutions have, however, experienced staggering problems because they engaged in the “weakened lending practices” I described in last year’s letter.  John Stumpf, CEO of Wells Fargo, aptly dissected the recent behavior of many lenders: “It is interesting that the industry has invented new ways to lose money when the old ways seemed to work just fine.” 
 
You may recall a 2003 Silicon Valley bumper sticker that implored, “Please, God, Just One More Bubble.”  Unfortunately, this wish was promptly granted, as just about all Americans came to believe that house prices would forever rise.  That convictio n made a borrower’s income and cash equity seem unimportant to lenders, who shoveled out money, confident that HPA – house price appreciation – would cure all problems.  Today, our country is experiencing widespread pain because of that erroneous belief.  As house prices fall, a huge amount of financial folly is being exposed.  You only learn who has been swimming naked when the tide goes out – and what we are witnessing at some of our largest financial institutions is an ugly sight. 
 
 Turning to happier thoughts, we can report that Berkshire’s newest acquisitions of size, TTI and Iscar, led by their CEOs, Paul Andrews and Jacob Harpaz respectively, performed magnificently in 2007.  Iscar is as impressive a manufacturing operation as I’ ve seen, a view I reported last year and that was confirmed by a visit I made in the fall to its extraordinary plant in Korea. 
 
 Finally, our insurance business – the cornerstone of Berkshire – had an excellent year.  Part of the reason is that we have the best collection of insurance managers in the business – more about them later.  But we also were very lucky in 2007, the second year in a row free of major insured catastrophes. 
 
 That party is over.  It’s a certainty that insurance-industry profit margins, including ours, will fall significantly in 2008.  Prices are down, and exposures inexorably rise.  Even if the U.S. has its third consecutive catastrophe-light year, industry profit marg ins will probably shrink by four percentage points or so.  If the winds roar or the earth trembles, results could be far worse.  So be prepared for lower insurance earnings during the next few years. 
 
Yardsticks 
 
 Berkshire has two major areas of value.  The first is our investments: stocks, bonds and cash equivalents.  At yearend these totaled $141 billion (not counting those in our finance or utility operations, which we assign to our second bucket of value). 
 
  
 *All per-share figures used in this report apply to  Berkshire’s A shares.  Figures for the B shares are 1/30
th of those shown for the A. 
 3 Insurance float – money we temporarily hold in our insurance operations that does not belong to us – funds $59 billion of our investments.  This fl oat is “free” as long as insurance underwriting breaks even, meaning that the premiums we receive equal the losses and expenses we incur.  Of course, insurance underwriting is volatile, swinging erratically between profits and losses.  Over our entire history, however, we’ve been profitable, and I expect we will average breake ven results or better in the future.  If we do that, our investments can be viewed as an unencumber ed source of value for Berkshire shareholders. 
 
 Berkshire’s second component of value is earnings that come from sources other than investments and insurance.  These earnings are delivered by our 66 non-insurance companies, itemized on page 76.  In our early years, we focused on the investment side.  During the past two decades, however, we have put ever more emphasis on the development of earnings from non-insurance businesses. 
 
 The following tables illustrate this shift.  In th e first we tabulate per-share investments at 14-year intervals.  We exclude those applicable to minority interests. 
 
 
YearPer-Share

1993 13,961 1979-1993 25.6% 
2007 90,343 1993-2007 14.3% 
 
 For the entire 42 years, our compounded annual gain in per-share investments was 27.1%.  But the trend has been downward as we increasingly used our available funds to buy operating businesses. 
 
 Here’s the record on how earnings of our non-insurance businesses have grown, again on a per-share basis and after applicable minority interests.

1993 212 1979-1993 19.1% 
2007 4,093 1993-2007 23.5% 
 
 For the entire period, the compounded annual gain was 17.8%, with gains accelerating as our focus shifted. 
 
 Though these tables may help you gain historical perspective and be useful in valuation, they are completely misleading in predicting future possibilities.  Berkshire’s past record can’t be duplicated or even approached.  Our base of assets and earnings is now far too large for us to make outsized gains in the future. 
 
 Charlie Munger, my partner at Berkshire, and I will continue to measure our progress by the two yardsticks I have just described and will regularly update you on the results.  Though we can’t come close to duplicating the past, we will do our best to make sure the future is not disappointing. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 In our efforts, we will be aided enormously by th e managers who have joined Berkshire.  This is an unusual group in several ways.  First, most of them have no financial need to work.  Many sold us their businesses for large sums and run them because they love doing so, not because they need the money.  Naturally they wish to be paid fairly, but money alon e is not the reason they work hard and productively. 
 4 A second, somewhat related, point about these managers is that they have exactly the job they want for the rest of their working years.  At almost any other company, key managers below the top aspire to keep climbing the pyramid.  For them, the subsidiary or division they manage today is a way station – or so they hope.  Indeed, if they are in their present positions five years from now, they may well feel like failures. 
 
 Conversely, our CEOs’ scorecards for success are not whether they obtain my job but instead are the long-term performances of their businesses.  Their decisions flow from a here-today, here-forever mindset.  I think our rare and hard-to-replicate managerial structure gives Berkshire a real advantage. 
 
Acquisitions 
 
 Though our managers may be the best, we will need large and sensible acquisitions to get the growth in operating earnings we wish.  Here, we made little progress in 2007 until very late in the year.  Then, on Christmas day, Charlie and I finally earne d our paychecks by contracting for the largest cash purchase in Berkshire’s history. 
 
 The seeds of this transaction were planted in 1954.  That fall, only three months into a new job, I was sent by my employers, Ben Graham and Jerry Newman, to a shareholders’ meeting of Rockwood Chocolate in Brooklyn.  A young fellow had recently taken control of this company, a manufacturer of assorted cocoa-based items.  He had then initiated a one-of-a-kind tender, offering 80 pounds of cocoa beans for each share of Rockwood stock.  I described this  transaction in a section of the 1988 annual report that explained arbitrage.  I also told you that Jay Pritzker – the young fellow mentioned above – was the business genius behind this tax-efficient idea, the possibilities for which had escaped all the other experts who had thought about buying Rockwood, including my bosses, Ben and Jerry. 
 
 At the meeting, Jay was friendly and gave me an  education on the 1954 tax code.  I came away very impressed.  Thereafter, I avidly followed Jay’s business dealings, which were many and brilliant.  His valued partner was his brother, Bob, who for nearly 50 years ran Marmon Group, the home for most of the Pritzker businesses. 
 
 Jay died in 1999, and Bob retired early in 2002.  Around then, the Pritzker family decided to gradually sell or reorganize certain of its holdings, including Marmon, a company operating 125 businesses, managed through nine sectors.  Marmon’s largest operation is Union Tank Car, which together with a Canadian counterpart owns 94,000 rail cars that are leased to various shippers.  The original cost of this fleet is $5.1 billion.  All told, Marmon has $7 billion in sales and about 20,000 employees. 
 
 We will soon purchase 60% of Marmon and will acq uire virtually all of the balance within six years.  Our initial outlay will be $4.5 billion, and the price of our later purchases will be based on a formula tied to earnings.  Prior to our entry into the picture, the Pritzker family received substantial consideration from Marmon’s distribution of cash, investments and certain businesses. 
 
 This deal was done in the way Jay would have liked.  We arrived at a price using only Marmon’s financial statements, employing no advisors and engaging in no nit-picking.  I knew that the business would be exactly as the Pritzkers represented, and they knew that we would close on the dot, however chaotic financial markets might be.  During the past year, many large deals have been renegotiated or killed entirely.  With the Pritzkers, as with Berkshire, a deal is a deal.  
 
 Marmon’s CEO, Frank Ptak, works closely with a long-time associate, John Nichols.  John was formerly the highly successful CEO of Illinois Tool Works (ITW), where he teamed with Frank to run a mix of industrial businesses.  Take a look at their ITW record; you’ll be impressed. 
 5 Byron Trott of Goldman Sachs – whose praises I sa ng in the 2003 report – facilitated the Marmon transaction.  Byron is the rare investment banker who puts himself in his client’s shoes.  Charlie and I trust him completely. 
 
 You’ll like the code name that Goldman Sachs assigned the deal.  Marmon entered the auto business in 1902 and exited it in 1933.  Along the way it manufactured the Wasp, a car that won the first Indianapolis 500 race, held in 1911.  So this deal was labeled “Indy 500.” 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 In May 2006, I spoke at a lunch at Ben Bridge, our Seattle-based jewelry chain.  The audience was a number of its vendors, among them Dennis Ulrich , owner of a company that manufactured gold jewelry. 
 
 In January 2007, Dennis called me, suggesting that with Berkshire’s support he could build a large jewelry supplier.  We soon made a deal for his business, simultaneously purchasing a supplier of about equal size.  The new company, Richline Group, has since made two smaller acquisitions.  Even with those, Richline is far below the earnings threshold we norm ally require for purchases.  I’m willing to bet, however, that Dennis – with the help of his partner, Dave Meleski – will build a large operation, earning good returns on capital employed. 
 
Businesses – The Great, the Good and the Gruesome 
 
 Let’s take a look at what kind of businesses turn us on.  And while we’re at it, let’s also discuss what we wish to avoid. 
 
 Charlie and I look for companies that have a) a business we understand; b) favorable long-term economics; c) able and trustworthy management; and d) a sensible price tag.  We like to buy the whole business or, if management is our partner, at least 80%.  When control-type purchases of quality aren’t available, though, we are also happy to simply buy small portions of great businesses by way of stock-market purchases.  It’s better to have a part interest in the Hope Diamond than to own all of a rhinestone. 
 
 A truly great business must have an enduring “moat” that protects excellent returns on invested capital.  The dynamics of capitalism guarantee that competitors will repeatedly assault any business “castle” that is earning high returns.  Therefore a formidable barrier such as a company’s being the low- cost producer (GEICO, Costco) or possessing a powerf ul world-wide brand (Coca-Cola, Gillette, American Express) is essential for sustained success.  Business history is filled with “Roman Candles,” companies whose moats proved illusory and were soon crossed. 
 
 Our criterion of “enduring” causes us to rule out companies in industries prone to rapid and continuous change.  Though capitalism’s “creative destru ction” is highly beneficial for society, it precludes investment certainty.  A moat that must be continuously rebuilt will eventually be no moat at all. 
 
 Additionally, this criterion eliminates the business whose success depends on having a great manager.  Of course, a terrific CEO is a huge asset for any enterprise, and at Berkshire we have an abundance of these managers.  Their abilities have created billions of dollars of value that would never have materialized if typical CEOs had been running their businesses.  
 
 But if a business requires a superstar to produce great results, the business itself cannot be deemed great.  A medical partnership led by your area’s premier brain surgeon may enjoy outsized and growing earnings, but that tells little about its future.  The pa rtnership’s moat will go when the surgeon goes.  You can count, though, on the moat of the Mayo Clinic to endure, even though you can’t name its CEO. 
 
 6 Long-term competitive advantage in a stable industry is what we seek in a business.  If that comes with rapid organic growth, great.  But even without organic growth, such a business is rewarding.  We will  
simply take the lush earnings of the business and use th em to buy similar businesses elsewhere.  There’s no  
rule that you have to invest money where you’ve earned it.  Indeed, it’s often a mistake to do so: Truly great businesses, earning huge returns on tangible assets, can’t for any extended period reinvest a large portion of their earnings internally at high rates of return. 
 
 Let’s look at the prototype of a dream busine ss, our own See’s Candy.  The boxed-chocolates industry in which it operates is unexciting: Per-capita consumption in the U.S. is extremely low and doesn’t grow.  Many once-important brands have disappeared, and only three companies have earned more than token profits over the last forty years.  Indeed, I believe that See’s, though it obtains the bulk of its revenues from only a few states, accounts for nearly half of the entire industry’s earnings. 
 
 At See’s, annual sales were 16 million pounds of candy when Blue Chip Stamps purchased the company in 1972.  (Charlie and I controlled Blue Chip at the time and later merged it into Berkshire.)  Last year See’s sold 31 million pounds, a growth rate of only 2% annually.  Yet its durable competitive advantage, built by the See’s family over a 50-year period, and strengthened subsequently by Chuck Huggins and Brad Kinstler, has produced extraordinary results for Berkshire. 
 
 We bought See’s for $25 million when its sales were $30 million and pre-tax earnings were less than $5 million.  The capital then required to conduct the business was $8 million.  (Modest seasonal debt was also needed for a few months each year.)  Co nsequently, the company was earning 60% pre-tax on invested capital.  Two factors helped to minimize the funds required for operations.  First, the product was sold for cash, and that eliminated accounts receivable.  Second, the production and distribution cycle was short, which minimized inventories. 
 
 Last year See’s sales were $383 million, and pre-tax profits were $82 million.  The capital now required to run the business is $40 million.  This means we have had to reinvest only $32 million since 1972 to handle the modest physical growth – and somewhat immodest financial growth – of the business.  In the meantime pre-tax earnings have totaled $1.35 billion.  All of that, except for the $32 million, has been sent to Berkshire (or, in the early years, to Blue Chip).  After paying corporate taxes on the profits, we have used the rest to buy other attractive businesses.  Just as Adam and Eve kick-started an activity that led to six billion humans, See’s has given birth to multiple new streams of cash for us.  (The biblical command to “be fruitful and multiply” is one we take seriously at Berkshire.) 
 
 There aren’t many See’s in Corporate America.  Typically, companies that increase their earnings from $5 million to $82 million require, say, $400 million or so of capital investment to finance their growth.  That’s because growing businesses have bot h working capital needs that increase in proportion to sales growth and significant requirements for fixed asset investments. 
 
 A company that needs large increases in capital to engender its growth may well prove to be a satisfactory investment.  There is, to follow through on our example, nothing shabby about earning $82 million pre-tax on $400 million of net tangible assets.  But that equation for the owner is vastly different from the See’s situation.  It’s far better to have an  ever-increasing stream of earnings with virtually no major capital requirements.  Ask Microsoft or Google. 
 
 One example of good, but far from sensational, business economics is our own FlightSafety.  This company delivers benefits to its customers that are the equal of those delivered by any business that I know of.  It also possesses a durable competitive advantage: Going to any other flight-training provider than the best is like taking the low bid on a surgical procedure. 
 7 Nevertheless, this business requires a significant reinvestment of earnings if it is to grow.  When we purchased FlightSafety in 1996, its pre-tax operatin g earnings were $111 million, and its net investment in fixed assets was $570 million.  Since our purchase, depreciation charges have totaled $923 million.  But capital expenditures have totaled $1.635 billion, most of that for simulators to match the new airplane models that are constantly being introduced.  (A simulator can cost us more than $12 million, and we have 273 of them.)  Our fixed assets, after depreciatio n, now amount to $1.079 billion.  Pre-tax operating earnings in 2007 were $270 million, a gain of $159 million since 1996.  That gain gave us a good, but far from See’s-like, return on our incremental investment of $509 million. 
 
 Consequently, if measured only by economic returns, FlightSafety is an excellent but not extraordinary business.  Its put-up-more-to-earn-more ex perience is that faced by most corporations.  For example, our large investment in regulated utilities falls squarely in this category.  We will earn considerably more money in this business ten years from  now, but we will invest many billions to make it. 
 
 Now let’s move to the gruesome.  The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, requires significant capital to engender the growth, and then ea rns little or no money.  Think airlines.  Here a durable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers.  Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk , he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down. 
 
 The airline industry’s demand for capital ever since that first flight has been insatiable.  Investors have poured money into a bottomless pit, attracted by growth when they should have been repelled by it.  And I, to my shame, participated in this foolishne ss when I had Berkshire buy U.S. Air preferred stock in 1989.  As the ink was drying on our check, the company went into a tailspin, and before long our preferred dividend was no longer being paid.  But we then got very lucky.  In one of the recurrent, but always misguided, bursts of optimism for airlines, we were actua lly able to sell our shares in 1998 for a hefty gain.  In the decade following our sale, the company went bankrupt.  Twice. 
 
 To sum up, think of three types of “savings accoun ts.”  The great one pays an extraordinarily high interest rate that will rise as the years pass.  The good one pays an attractive rate of interest that will be earned also on deposits that are added.  Finally, the gruesome account both pays an inadequate interest rate and requires you to keep adding money at those disappointing returns. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 And now it’s confession time.  It should be noted that no consultant, board of directors or investment banker pushed me into the mistakes I will describe.  In tennis parlance, they were all unforced errors. 
 
 To begin with, I almost blew the See’s purchase.  The seller was asking $30 million, and I was adamant about not going above $25 million.  Fortunately, he caved.  Otherwise I would have balked, and that $1.35 billion would have gone to somebody else. 
 
 About the time of the See’s purchase, Tom Murphy, then running Capital Cities Broadcasting, called and offered me the Dallas-Fort Worth NBC station for $35 million.  The station came with the Fort Worth paper that Capital Cities was buying, and under the “cross-ownership” rules Murph had to divest it.  I knew that TV stations were See’s-like businesses that required virtually no capital investment and had excellent prospects for growth.  They were simple to run and showered cash on their owners. 
 
 Moreover, Murph, then as now, was a close frien d, a man I admired as an extraordinary manager and outstanding human being.  He knew the television business forward and backward and would not have called me unless he felt a purchase was certain to work.  In effect Murph whispered “buy” into my ear.  But I didn’t listen. 
 
 8 In 2006, the station earned $73 million pre-tax, bringing its total earnings since I turned down the deal to at least $1 billion – almost all available to its  owner for other purposes.  Moreover, the property now has a capital value of about $800 million.  Why did I say “no”?  The only explanation is that my brain had gone on vacation and forgot to notify me.  (My behavior resembled that of a politician Molly Ivins once described: “If his I.Q. was any lower, you would have to water him twice a day.”) 
 
 Finally, I made an even worse mistake when I sa id “yes” to Dexter, a shoe business I bought in 1993 for $433 million in Berkshire stock (25,203 shar es of A).  What I had assessed as durable competitive advantage vanished within a few years.  But that’s just the beginning: By using Berkshire stock, I compounded this error hugely.  That move made the cost to Berkshire shareholders not $400 million, but rather $3.5 billion.  In essence, I gave away 1.6% of a wonderful business – one now valued at $220 billion – to buy a worthless business. 
 
 To date, Dexter is the worst deal that I’ve made.  But I’ll make more mistakes in the future – you can bet on that.  A line from Bobby Bare’s country so ng explains what too often happens with acquisitions: “I’ve never gone to bed with an ugly woman, but I’ve sure woke up with a few.” 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 Now, let’s examine the four major operating sectors of Berkshire.  Each sector has vastly different balance sheet and income account characteristics.  Ther efore, lumping them together impedes analysis.  So we’ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them. 
 
Insurance 
 
 The best anecdote I’ve heard during the current presidential campaign came from Mitt Romney, who asked his wife, Ann, “When we were young, did you ever in your wildest dreams think I might be president?”  To which she replied, “Honey, you weren’t in my wildest dreams.” 
 
 When we first entered the property/casualty insurance business in 1967, my wildest dreams did not envision our current operation.  Here’s how we did in the first five years after purchasing National Indemnity: 
 
Year Underwriting Profit (Loss) Float
                              (in millions) 
1967 $  0.4 $18.5 
1968 0.6 21.3 
1969 0.1 25.4 
1970 (0.4) 39.4 
1971 1.4 65.6 
 
 To put it charitably, we were a slow starter.  But th ings changed.  Here’s the record of the last five years: 
 
Year Underwriting Profit (Loss) Float
                               (in millions) 
2003 $1,718 $44,220 
2004 1,551 46,094 
2005 53 49,287 
2006 3,838 50,887 
2007 3,374 58,698 
 
 This metamorphosis has been accomplished by some  extraordinary managers.  Let’s look at what each has achieved. 
 9 
• GEICO possesses the widest moat of any of our in surers, one carefully protected and expanded by Tony Nicely, its CEO.  Last year – again – GEICO had the best growth record among major auto insurers, increasing its market share to 7.2%.  Wh en Berkshire acquired control in 1995, that share was 2.5%.  Not coincidentally, annual ad expend itures by GEICO have increased from $31 million to $751 million during the same period. 
 
Tony, now 64, joined GEICO at 18.  Every day si nce, he has been passionate about the company – proud of how it could both save money for its cu stomers and provide growth opportunities for its associates.  Even now, with sales at $12 billion, To ny feels GEICO is just getting started.  So do I. 
 
Here’s some evidence.  In the last three years, GEICO has increased its share of the motorcycle market from 2.1% to 6%.  We’ve also recently begun writing policies on ATVs and RVs.  And in November we wrote our first commercial auto policy.  GEICO and National Indemnity are working together in the commercial field, and early results are very encouraging. 
 
Even in aggregate, these lines will remain a small fraction of our personal auto volume.  Nevertheless, they should deliver a growing stream of underwriting profits and float. 
 
• General Re, our international reinsurer, is by far our largest source of “home-grown” float – $23 billion at yearend.  This operation is now a huge asset for Berkshire.  Our ownership, however, had a shaky start. 
 
For decades, General Re was the Tiffany of rein surers, admired by all for its underwriting skills and discipline.  This reputation, unfortunately, outlived its factual underpinnings, a flaw that I completely missed when I made the decision in 1998 to merge with General Re.  The General Re of 1998 was not operated as the General Re of 1968 or 1978. 
 
Now, thanks to Joe Brandon, General Re’s CEO, and his partner, Tad Montross, the luster of the company has been restored.  Joe and Tad have been running the business for six years and have been doing first-class business in a first-class way, to use the words of J. P. Morgan.  They have restored discipline to underwriting, reserving and the selection of clients. 
 
Their job was made more difficult by costly and time-consuming legacy problems, both in the U.S. and abroad.  Despite that diversion, Joe and Tad have delivered excellent underwriting results while skillfully repositioning the company for the future. 
 
• Since joining Berkshire in 1986, Ajit Jain has built a truly great specialty reinsurance operation from scratch.  For one-of-a-kind mammoth transactions, the world now turns to him. 
 
Last year I told you in detail about the Equitas tr ansfer of huge, but capped, liabilities to Berkshire for a single premium of $7.1 billion.  At this very early date, our experience has been good.  But this doesn’t tell us much because it’s just one st raw in a fifty-year-or-more wind.  What we know for sure, however, is that the London team who joined us, headed by Scott Moser, is first-rate and has become a valuable asset for our insurance business. 
 
• Finally, we have our smaller operations, which serve specialized segments of the insurance market.  In aggregate, these companies have performed extraordinarily well, earning above- average underwriting profits and delivering valuable float for investment. 
 
Last year BoatU.S., headed by Bill Oakerson, was added to the group.  This company manages an association of about 650,000 boat owners, providing them services similar to those offered by AAA auto clubs to drivers.  Among the association’s offerings is boat insurance.  Learn more about this operation by visiting its display at the annual meeting.

Regulated Utility Business 
 
 Berkshire has an 87.4% (diluted) interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which owns a wide variety of utility operations.  The largest of these are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, whose 3.8 million electric customers make it the third largest distributor of electricity in the U.K.; (2) MidAmerican Energy, which serves 720,000 electric customers, primarily in Iowa; (3) Pacific Power and Rocky Mountain Power, serving about 1.7 million electric customers in six western states; and (4) Kern River and Northern Natural pipelines, which carry about 8% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S. 
 
Our partners in ownership of MidAmerican are Walter Scott, and its two terrific managers, Dave Sokol and Greg Abel.  It’s unimportant how many votes each party has; we make major moves only when we are unanimous in thinking them wise.  Eight years of working with Dave, Greg and Walter have underscored my original belief: Berkshire couldn’t have better partners. 
 
 Somewhat incongruously, MidAmerican also owns th e second largest real estate brokerage firm in the U.S., HomeServices of America.  This company operates through 20 locally-branded firms with 18,800 agents.  Last year was a slow year for residential sales, and 2008 will probably be slower.  We will continue, however, to acquire quality brokerage operatio ns when they are available at sensible prices. 
 
 Here are some key figures on MidAmerican’s operation:

 11 We agreed to purchase 35,464,337 shares of MidAmerican at $35.05 per share in 1999, a year in which its per-share earnings were $2.59.  Why the odd figure of $35.05?  I originally decided the business was worth $35.00 per share to Berkshire.  Now, I’m a “one-price” guy (remember See’s?) and for several days the investment bankers representing MidAmerican had no luck in getting me to increase Berkshire’s offer.  But, finally, they caught me in a moment of weakness, and I caved, telling them I would go to $35.05.  With that, I explained, they could tell their client they had wrung the last nickel out of me.  At the time, it hurt. 
 
 Later on, in 2002, Berkshire purchased 6,700,000 shares at $60 to help finance the acquisition of one of our pipelines.  Lastly, in 2006, when MidAmerican bought PacifiCorp, we purchased 23,268,793 shares at $145 per share. 
 
 In 2007, MidAmerican earned $15.78 per share.  However, 77¢ of that was non-recurring – a reduction in deferred tax at our British utility, resulting from a lowering of the U.K. corporate tax rate.  So call normalized earnings $15.01 per share.  And ye s, I’m glad I wilted and offered the extra nickel.

*Does not include purchase-accounting adjustments. 
 
  This motley group, which sells products ranging from lollipops to motor homes, earned a pleasing 23% on average tangible net worth last year.  It’s not eworthy also that these operations used only minor financial leverage in achieving that return.  Clearly we own some terrific businesses.  We purchased many of them, however, at large premiums to net worth – a point reflected in the goodwill item shown on the balance sheet – and that fact reduces the earnings on our average carrying value to 9.8%. 
 
 12 Here are a few newsworthy items about companies in this sector: 
 
• Shaw, Acme Brick, Johns Manville and MiTek were all hurt in 2007 by the sharp housing downturn, with their pre-tax earnings declining 27 %, 41%, 38%, and 9% respectively.  Overall, these companies earned $941 million pre-tax compared to $1.296 billion in 2006.  
 
Last year, Shaw, MiTek and Acme contracted fo r tuck-in acquisitions that will help future earnings.  You can be sure they will be looking for more of these.  
 
• In a tough year for retailing, our standouts were See’s, Borsheims and Nebraska Furniture Mart. 
 
Two years ago Brad Kinstler was made CEO of See’s.  We very seldom move managers from one industry to another at Berkshire.  But we made an exception with Brad, who had previously run our uniform company, Fechheimer, and Cypress Insu rance.  The move could not have worked out better.  In his two years, profits at See’s have increased more than 50%. 
 
At Borsheims, sales increased 15.1%, helped by  a 27% gain during Shareholder Weekend.  Two years ago, Susan Jacques suggested that we rem odel and expand the store.  I was skeptical, but Susan was right. 
 
Susan came to Borsheims 25 years ago as a $4-an-hour saleswoman.  Though she lacked a managerial background, I did not hesitate to make her CEO in 1994.  She’s smart, she loves the business, and she loves her associates.  That beats having an MBA degree any time. 
 
(An aside: Charlie and I are not big fans of resumes.  Instead, we focus on brains, passion and integrity.  Another of our great managers is Cathy Baron Tamraz, who has significantly increased Business Wire’s earnings since we purchased it early in 2006.  She is an owner’s dream.  It is positively dangerous to stand between Cathy and a business prospect.  Cathy, it should be noted, began her career as a cab driver.) 
 
Finally, at Nebraska Furniture Mart, earnings hit a record as our Omaha and Kansas City stores each had sales of about $400 million.  These, by  some margin, are the two top home furnishings stores in the country.  In a disastrous year for many furniture retailers, sales at Kansas City increased 8%, while in Omaha the gain was 6%.  
 
Credit the remarkable Blumkin brothers, Ron and Irv, for this performance.  Both are close personal friends of mine and great businessmen. 
 
• Iscar continues its wondrous ways.  Its products are small carbide cutting tools that make large and very expensive machine tools more productive.  The raw material for carbide is tungsten, mined in China.  For many decades, Iscar moved tungsten to  Israel, where brains turned it into something far more valuable.  Late in 2007, Iscar opened a large plant in Dalian, China.  In effect, we’ve now moved the brains to the tungsten.  Major opportu nities for growth await Iscar.  Its management team, led by Eitan Wertheimer, Jacob Harpaz, and Da nny Goldman, is certain to make the most of them.  
 
• Flight services set a record in 2007 with pr e-tax earnings increasing 49% to $547 million.  Corporate aviation had an extraordinary year worldwide, and both of our companies – as runaway leaders in their fields – fully participated. 
 
FlightSafety, our pilot training business, gained 14% in revenues and 20% in pre-tax earnings.  We estimate that we train about 58% of U.S. corporate pilots.  Bruc e Whitman, the company’s CEO, inherited this leadership position in 2003 fr om Al Ueltschi, the father of advanced flight training, and has proved to be a worthy successor. 
 13At NetJets, the inventor of fractional-ownership of jets, we also remain the unchallenged leader.  We now operate 487 planes in the U.S. and 135 in Europe, a fleet more than twice the size of that operated by our three major competitors combined.  Because our share of the large-cabin market is near 90%, our lead in value terms is far greater. 
 
The NetJets brand – with its promise of safety, se rvice and security – grows stronger every year.  Behind this is the passion of one man, Richard Santulli.  If you were to pick someone to join you in a foxhole, you couldn’t do better than Rich.  No  matter what the obstacles, he just doesn’t stop. 
 
Europe is the best example of how Rich’s tenac ity leads to success.  For the first ten years we made little financial progress there, actually runnin g up cumulative losses of $212 million.  After Rich brought Mark Booth on board to run Europe, however, we began to gain traction.  Now we have real momentum, and last year earnings tripled. 
 
In November, our directors met at NetJets head quarters in Columbus and got a look at the sophisticated operation there.  It is responsible for 1,000 or so flights a day in all kinds of weather, with customers expecting top-notch service.  Ou r directors came away impressed by the facility and its capabilities – but even more impressed by Rich and his associates. 
 
Finance and Finance Products 
 
 Our major operation in this category is Clayton Homes, the largest U.S. manufacturer and marketer of manufactured homes.  Clayton’s market share hit a record 31% last y ear.  But industry volume continues to shrink:  Last year, manufactured home sales were 96,000, down from 131,000 in 2003, the year we bought Clayton.  (At the time, it should be remembered, some commentators criticized its directors for selling at a cyclical bottom.) 
 
 Though Clayton earns money from both manufacturing and retailing its homes, most of its earnings come from an $11 billion loan portfolio, covering 300,000 borrowers.  That’s why we include Clayton’s operation in this finance section.  Despite the many problems that surfaced during 2007 in real estate finance, the Clayton portfolio is performing well.  Delinquencies, foreclosures and losses during the year were at rates similar to those we experienced in our previous years of ownership. 
 
 Clayton’s loan portfolio is financed by Berkshire.  For this funding, we charge Clayton one percentage point over Berkshire’s borrowing cost – a fee that amounted to $85 million last year.  Clayton’s 2007 pre-tax earnings of $526 million are after its paying this fee.  The flip side of this transaction is that Berkshire recorded $85 million as income, which is included in “other” in the following table.

 The leasing operations tabulated are XTRA, which rents trailers, and CORT, which rents furniture.  Utilization of trailers was down considerably in 2007 and that led to a drop in earnings at XTRA.  That company also borrowed $400 million last year and distributed the proceeds to Berkshire.  The resulting higher interest it is now paying further reduced XTRA’s earnings. 
 14 Clayton, XTRA and CORT are all good businesses , very ably run by Kevin Clayton, Bill Franz and Paul Arnold.  Each has made tuck-in acquisitions  during Berkshire’s ownership.  More will come.

*This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP “cost” differs in a few cases because of write-ups or write-downs that have been required. 
 
 Overall, we are delighted by the business performance of our investees.  In 2007, American Express, Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble, three of our four largest holdings, increased per-share earnings by 12%, 14% and 14%.  The fourth, Wells Fargo, had a small decline in earnings because of the popping of the real estate bubble.  Nevertheless, I believe its intr insic value increased, even if only by a minor amount. 
 
 In the strange world department, note that American Express and Wells Fargo were both organized by Henry Wells and William Fargo, Amex in 1850 and Wells in 1852.  P&G and Coke began business in 1837 and 1886 respectively.  Start-ups are not our game. 
 
 I should emphasize that we do not measure the progress of our in vestments by what their market prices do during any given year.  Rather, we evaluate their performance by the two methods we apply to the businesses we own.  The first test is improvement in earnings, with our making due allowance for industry conditions.  The second test, more subjective, is whether their “moats” – a metaphor for the superiorities they possess that make life difficult for their competitors – have widened during the year.  All of the “big four” scored positively on that test. 
 15 We made one large sale last year.  In 2002 and 2003 Berkshire bought 1.3% of PetroChina for $488 million, a price that valued the entire business at about $37 billion.  Charlie and I then felt that the company was worth about $100 billion.  By 2007, two factors had materially increased its value: the price of oil had climbed significantly, and PetroChina’s management had done a great job in building oil and gas reserves.  In the second half of last year, the market  value of the company rose to $275 billion, about what we thought it was worth compared to other giant oil companies.  So we sold our holdings for $4 billion. 
 
 A footnote: We paid the IRS tax of $1.2 billion on our PetroChina gain.  This sum paid all costs of the U.S. government – defense, social security, you name it – for about four hours. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 Last year I told you that Berkshire had 62 derivative contracts that I manage.  (We also have a few left in the General Re runoff book.)  Today, we ha ve 94 of these, and they fall into two categories. 
 
 First, we have written 54 contracts that require us to make payments if certain bonds that are included in various high-yield indices default.  These contracts expire at various times from 2009 to 2013.  At yearend we had received $3.2 billion in premiums on these co ntracts; had paid $472 million in losses; and in the worst case (though it is extremely unlikely to occur) could be required to pay an additional $4.7 billion. 
 
 We are certain to make many more payments.  But I believe that on premium revenues alone, these contracts will prove profitable, leaving aside what we can earn on the large sums we hold.  Our yearend liability for this exposure was recorded at $1.8 billion and is included in “Derivative Contract Liabilities” on our balance sheet. 
 
 The second category of contracts involves various put options we have sold on four stock indices (the S&P 500 plus three foreign indices).  These puts had original terms of either 15 or 20 years and were struck at the market.  We have received premiums of $4.5 billion, and we recorded a liability at yearend of $4.6 billion.  The puts in these contracts are exercisable only at their expiration dates, which occur between 2019 and 2027, and Berkshire will then need to make a payment only if the index in question is quoted at a level below that existing on the day that the put was writte n.  Again, I believe these contracts, in aggregate, will be profitable and that we will, in addition, receive substantial income from our investment of the premiums we hold during the 15- or 20-year period. 
 
 Two aspects of our derivative contracts are particul arly important.  First, in all cases we hold the money, which means that we have no counterparty risk. 
 
 Second, accounting rules for our derivative contracts differ from those applying to our investment portfolio.  In that portfolio, changes in value are applied to the net worth shown on Berkshire’s balance sheet, but do not affect earnings unless we sell (or write down) a holding.  Changes in the value of a derivative contract, however, must be applied each quarter to earnings. 
 
 Thus, our derivative positions will sometimes cause large swings in reported earnings, even though Charlie and I might believe the intrinsic value of these positions has changed little.  He and I will not be bothered by these swings – even though they could easily amount to $1 billion or more in a quarter – and we hope you won’t be either.  You will recall that in our catastrophe insurance business, we are always ready to trade increased volatility in reported earnings in  the short run for greater gains in net worth in the long run.  That is our philosophy in derivatives as well. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 The U.S. dollar weakened further in 2007 against major currencies, and it’s no mystery why: Americans like buying products made elsewhere more than the rest of the world likes buying products made in the U.S.  Inevitably, that causes Amer ica to ship about $2 billion of IOUs and assets daily to the rest of the world.  And over time, that puts pressure on the dollar. 
 16 When the dollar falls, it both makes our products cheaper for foreigners to buy and their products more expensive for U.S. citizens.  That’s why a falling cu rrency is supposed to cure a trade deficit.  Indeed, the U.S. deficit has undoubtedly been tempered by the large drop in the dollar.  But ponder this:  In 2002 when the Euro averaged 94.6¢, our trade deficit with Germany (the fifth largest of our trading partners) was $36 billion, whereas in 2007, with the Euro averagi ng $1.37, our deficit with Germany was up to $45 billion.  Similarly, the Canadian dollar averaged 64¢ in 2002 and 93¢ in 2007.  Yet our trade deficit with Canada rose as well, from $50 billion in 2002 to $64 billion in 2007.  So far, at least, a plunging dollar has not done much to bring our trade activity into balance. 
 
 There’s been much talk recently of sovereign wealth funds and how they are buying large pieces of American businesses.  This is our doing, not some nefarious plot by foreign governments.  Our trade equation guarantees massive foreign investment in the U.S.  When we force-feed $2 billion daily to the rest of the world, they must invest in something here.  Why should we complain when they choose stocks over bonds? 
 
 Our country’s weakening currency is not the fault of OPEC, China, etc.  Other developed countries rely on imported oil and compete against Chinese imports just as we do.  In developing a sensible trade policy, the U.S. should not single out countries to punish or industries to protect.  Nor should we take actions likely to evoke retaliatory behavior that will reduce America’s exports, true trade that benefits both our country and the rest of the world. 
 
 Our legislators should recognize, however, that  the current imbalances are unsustainable and should therefore adopt policies that will materially reduce them sooner rather than later.  Otherwise our $2 billion daily of force-fed dollars to the rest of the world may produce global indigestion of an unpleasant sort.  (For other comments about the unsustainability of our trade deficits, see Alan Greenspan’s comments on November 19, 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee’s minutes of June 29, 2004, and Ben Bernanke’s statement on September 11, 2007.) 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 At Berkshire we held only one direct currency position during 2007.  That was in – hold your breath – the Brazilian real.  Not long ago, swapping dollars for reals would have been unthinkable.  After all, during the past century five versions of Brazilian currency have, in effect, turned into confetti.  As has been true in many countries whose currencies have  periodically withered and died, wealthy Brazilians sometimes stashed large sums in the U.S. to preserve their wealth. 
 
 But any Brazilian who followed this apparently prudent course would have lost half his net worth over the past five years.  Here’s the year-by-year record (indexed) of the real versus the dollar from the end of 2002 to yearend 2007: 100; 122; 133; 152; 166; 199.  Every year the real went up and the dollar fell.  Moreover, during much of this period the Brazilian government was actually holding down the value of the real and supporting our currency by buying dollars in the market. 
 
 Our direct currency positions have yielded $2.3 b illion of pre-tax profits over the past five years, and in addition we have profited by holding bonds of U.S. companies that are denominated in other currencies.  For example, in 2001 and 2002 we purchased €310 million Amazon.com, Inc. 6 7/8 of 2010 at 57% of par.  At the time, Amazon bonds were priced as  “junk” credits, though they were anything but.  (Yes, Virginia, you can occasionally find markets that are ridiculously inefficient – or at least you can find them anywhere except at the finance departments of some leading business schools.)   
 
 The Euro denomination of the Amazon bonds was a further, and important, attraction for us.  The Euro was at 95¢ when we bought in 2002.  Therefore, our cost in dollars came to only $169 million.  Now the bonds sell at 102% of par and the Euro is worth $1.47.  In 2005 and 2006 some of our bonds were called and we received $253 million for them.  Our remaining bonds were valued at $162 million at yearend.  Of our $246 million of realized and unrealized gain, about $118 million is attributable to the fall in the dollar.  Currencies do matter. 
 17 At Berkshire, we will attempt to further increase our stream of direct and indirect foreign earnings.  Even if we are successful, however, our assets and earnings will always be concentrated in the U.S.  Despite our country’s many imperfections and unrelenting problems of one sort or another, America’s rule of law, market-responsive economic system, and belief in meritocracy are almost certain to produce ever- growing prosperity for its citizens.

 As I have told you before, we have for some time been well-prepared for CEO succession because we have three outstanding internal candidates.  The board knows exactly whom it would pick if I were to become unavailable, either because of death or diminishing abilities.  And that would still leave the board with two backups. 
 
 Last year I told you that we would also prom ptly complete a succession plan for the investment job at Berkshire, and we have indeed now identified four candidates who could succeed me in managing investments.  All manage substantial sums currently, and all have indicated a strong interest in coming to Berkshire if called.  The board knows the strengths of the four and would expect to hire one or more if the need arises.  The candidates are young to middle-aged, well-to-do to rich, and all wish to work for Berkshire for reasons that go beyond compensation. 
 
 (I’ve reluctantly discarded the notion of my continuing to manage the portfolio after my death – abandoning my hope to give new meaning to the term “thinking outside the box.”) 
 
Fanciful Figures – How Public Companies Juice Earnings 
 
 Former Senator Alan Simpson famously said: “Those who travel the high road in Washington need not fear heavy traffic.”  If he had sought truly deserted streets, however, the Senator should have looked to Corporate America’s accounting. 
 
 An important referendum on which road businesses prefer occurred in 1994.  America’s CEOs had just strong-armed the U.S. Senate into ordering the Financial Accounting Standards Board to shut up, by a vote that was 88-9.  Before that rebuke the FASB had shown the audacity – by unanimous agreement, no less – to tell corporate chieftains that the stock optio ns they were being awarded represented a form of compensation and that their value should be recorded as an expense. 
 
 After the senators voted, the FASB – now educat ed on accounting principles by the Senate’s 88 closet CPAs – decreed that companies could choose between two methods of reporting on options.  The preferred treatment would be to expense their value, but it would also be allowable for companies to ignore the expense as long as their options were issued at market value. 
 
 A moment of truth had now arrived for America’s CEOs, and their reaction was not a pretty sight.  During the next six years, exactly two of the 500 companies in the S&P chose the preferred route.  CEOs of the rest opted for the low road, thereby ignoring a large and obvious expense in order to report higher “earnings.”  I’m sure some of them also felt that if they opted for expensing, thei r directors might in future years think twice before approving the mega-grants the managers longed for. 
 
 It turned out that for many CEOs even the low road wasn’t good enough.  Under the weakened rule, there remained earnings consequences if options were issued with a strike price below market value.  No problem.  To avoid that bothersome rule, a numb er of companies surreptitiously backdated options to falsely indicate that they were granted at current market prices, when in fact they were dished out at prices well below market. 
 
 Decades of option-accounting nonsense have now been put to rest, but other accounting choices remain – important among these the investment-return assumption a company uses in calculating pension expense.  It will come as no surprise that many comp anies continue to choose an assumption that allows them to report less-than-solid “earnings.” For the 363 companies in the S&P that have pension plans, this assumption in 2006 averaged 8%.  Let’s look at the chances of that being achieved. 
 18 The average holdings of bonds and cash for all pension funds is about 28%, and on these assets returns can be expected to be no more than 5%. Higher yields, of course, are obtainable but they carry with them a risk of commensurate (or greater) loss. 
 
 This means that the remaining 72% of assets – which are mostly in equities, either held directly or through vehicles such as hedge funds or private-equity investments – must earn 9.2% in order for the fund overall to achieve the postulated 8%.  And that return must be delivered after all fees, which are now far higher than they have ever been. 
 
 How realistic is this expectation?  Let’s revisit some data I mentioned two years ago: During the 20
th Century, the Dow advanced from 66 to 11,497.  This gain, though it appears huge, shrinks to 5.3% when compounded annually.  An investor who owned the Dow throughout the century would also have received generous dividends for much of the period, but only about 2% or so in the final years.  It was a wonderful century. 
 
 Think now about this century.  For investors to merely match that 5.3% market-value gain, the Dow – recently below 13,000 – would need to close at about 2,000,000 on December 31, 2099.  We are now eight years into this century, and we have racked up less than 2,000 of the 1,988,000 Dow points the market needed to travel in this hundred years to equal the 5.3% of the last. 
 
 It’s amusing that commentators regularly hyperventilate at the prospect of the Dow crossing an even number of thousands, such as 14,000 or 15,000.  If they keep reacting that way, a 5.3% annual gain for the century will mean they experience at least 1,986 seizures during the next 92 years.  While anything is possible, does anyone really believe this is the most likely outcome? 
 
 Dividends continue to run about 2%.  Even if stocks were to average the 5.3% annual appreciation of the 1900s, the equity portion of plan assets – allowing for expenses of .5% – would produce no more than 7% or so.  And .5% may well understate costs, given the presence of layers of consultants and high-priced managers (“helpers”). 
 
 Naturally, everyone expects to be above average.  And those helpers – bless their hearts – will certainly encourage their clients in this belief.  But, as a class, the helper-aided group must be below average.  The reason is simple: 1) Investors, overall,  will necessarily earn an average return, minus costs they incur; 2) Passive and index investors, through their very inactivity, will earn that average minus costs that are very low; 3) With that group earning average returns, so must the remaining group – the active investors.  But this group will incur high transaction, management, and advisory costs.  Therefore, the active investors will have their returns diminished by  a far greater percentage than will their inactive brethren.  That means that the passive group – the “know-nothings” – must win. 
 
 I should mention that people who expect to earn 10% annually from equities during this century – envisioning that 2% of that will come from dividends and 8% from price appreciation – are implicitly forecasting a level of about 24,000,000 on the Dow by 2100.  If your adviser talks to you about double-digit returns from equities, explain this math to him – not that it will faze him.  Many helpers are apparently direct descendants of the queen in Alice in Wonderland, who said: “Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.”  Beware the glib helper who fills your head with fantasies while he fills his pockets with fees. 
 
 Some companies have pension plans in Europe as well as in the U.S. and, in their accounting, almost all assume that the U.S. plans will earn more than  the non-U.S. plans.  This discrepancy is puzzling: Why should these companies not put their U.S. managers in charge of the non-U.S. pension assets and let them work their magic on these assets as well?  I’ve never seen this puzzle explained.  But the auditors and actuaries who are charged with vetting the return assumptions seem to have no problem with it. 
 19 What is no puzzle, however, is why CEOs opt for a high investment assumption: It lets them report higher earnings.  And if they are wrong, as I be lieve they are, the chickens won’t come home to roost until long after they retire. 
 
 After decades of pushing the envelope – or worse – in its attempt to report the highest number possible for current earnings, Corporate America should ease up.  It should listen to my partner, Charlie: “If you’ve hit three balls out of bounds to the left, aim a little to the right on the next swing.”

 Whatever pension-cost surprises are in store fo r shareholders down the road, these jolts will be surpassed many times over by those experienced by taxpayers.  Public pension promises are huge and, in many cases, funding is woefully inadequate.  Because th e fuse on this time bomb is long, politicians flinch from inflicting tax pain, given that problems will only become apparent long after these officials have departed.  Promises involving very early retirement – sometimes to those in their low 40s – and generous cost-of-living adjustments are easy for these officials to make.  In a world where people are living longer and inflation is certain, those promises will be anything but easy to keep.

 Having laid out the failures of an “honor system” in American accounting, I need to point out that this is exactly the system existing at Berkshire for a truly huge balance-sheet item.  In every report we make to you, we must guesstimate the loss reserves for our insurance units.  If our estimate is wrong, it means that both our balance sheet and our earnings statem ent will be wrong.  So naturally we do our best to make these guesses accurate.  Nevertheless, in every report our estimate is sure to be wrong . 
 
 At yearend 2007, we show an insurance liability of  $56 billion that represents our guess as to what we will eventually pay for all loss events that occurred before yearend (except for about $3 billion of the reserve that has been discounted to present value).  We know of many thousands of events and have put a dollar value on each that reflects what we believe we  will pay, including the associated costs (such as attorney’s fees) that we will incur in the payment process.  In some cases, among them claims for certain serious injuries covered by worker’s compensation, payments will be made for 50 years or more. 
 
 We also include a large reserve for losses that occu rred before yearend but that we have yet to hear about.  Sometimes, the insured itself does not know that a loss has occurred.  (Think of an embezzlement that remains undiscovered for years.)  We sometimes hear about losses from policies that covered our insured many decades ago. 
 
 A story I told you some years back illustrates our problem in accurately estimating our loss liability:  A fellow was on an important business trip in Europe when his sister called to tell him that their dad had died.  Her brother explained that he couldn’t get back but said to spare nothing on the funeral, whose cost he would cover.  When he returned, his sister told him that the service had been beautiful and presented him with bills totaling $8,000.  He paid up but a month later received a bill from the mortuary for $10.  He paid that, too – and still another $10 charge he received a month later.  When a third $10 invoice was sent to him the following month, the perplexed man called his sister to ask what was going on.  “Oh,” she replied, “I forgot to tell you.  We buried Dad in a rented suit.” 
 
 At our insurance companies we have an unknown, but most certainly large, number of “rented suits” buried around the world.  We try to estimate the bill for them accurately.  In ten or twenty years, we will even be able to make a good guess as to how inaccurate our present guess is.  But even that guess will be subject to surprises.  I personally believe our stat ed reserves are adequate, but I’ve been wrong several times in the past. 
 20The Annual Meeting 
 
 Our meeting this year will be held on Saturday, May 3rd.  As always, the doors will open at the Qwest Center at 7 a.m., and a new Berkshire movie will be shown at 8:30.  At 9:30 we will go directly to the question-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest’s stands) will last until 3:00.  Then, after a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:15.  If you decide to leave during the day’s question periods, please do so while Charlie is talking. 
 
 The best reason to exit, of course is to shop.  We will help you do that by filling the 194,300- square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting area with the products of Berkshire subsidiaries.  Last year, the 27,000 people who came to the meeting did their part, a nd almost every location racked up record sales.  But you can do better.  (If necessary, I’ll lock the doors.) 
 
 This year we will again showcase a Clayton ho me (featuring Acme brick, Shaw carpet, Johns Manville insulation, MiTek fasteners, Carefree awnings and NFM furniture).  You will find that this 1,550-square-foot home, priced at $69,500, delivers excep tional value.  And after you purchase the house, consider also acquiring the Forest River RV and pontoon boat on display nearby. 
 
 GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of them ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes.  In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a special shareholder discount (usually 8%).  This special offer is permitted by 45 of the 50 jurisdictions in which we operate.  (One supplemental point: The discount  is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that given certain groups.)  Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money.  For at least 50% of you, I believe we can. 
 
 On Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets available for your inspection.  Stop by the NetJets booth at the Qwest to learn about viewing these planes.  Come to Omaha by bus; leave in your new plane.  And take all the hair gel and scissors that you wish on board with you. 
 
 Next, if you have any money left, visit the Bookworm, where you will find about 25 books and DVDs – all discounted – led again by Poor Charlie’s Almanack.  Without any advertising or bookstore placement, Charlie’s book has now remarkably sold nearly 50,000 copies.  For those of you who can’t make the meeting, go to 
poorcharliesalmanack.com  to order a copy. 
 
 An attachment to the proxy material that is encl osed with this report explains how you can obtain the credential you will need for admission to the meeti ng and other events.  As for plane, hotel and car reservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  Carol Pedersen, who handles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it.  Hotel rooms can be hard to find, but work with Carol and you will get one. 
 
 At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing.  We initiated this special event at NFM eleven years ago, and sales during the “Weekend” grew  from $5.3 million in 1997 to $30.9 million in 2007.  This is more volume than most furniture stores register in a year. 
 
 To obtain the Berkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Thursday, May 1st and Monday, May 5
th inclusive, and also present your meeting credential.  The period’s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you.  We appreciate their cooperation.  NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday.  On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a Baja Beach Bash featuring beef and chicken tacos. 
 21 At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events.  The first will be a cocktail reception from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, May 2
nd.  The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 4
th, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.  On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. 
 
 We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend.  For your convenience, therefore, shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 28
th through Saturday, May 10th.  During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that shows you are a Berkshire holder. 
 
 On Sunday, in a tent outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, will take on all comers – who will have their eyes wide open – in groups of six.  Nearby, Norman Beck, a remarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers.  Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the world’s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. 
 
 Gorat’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 4th, and will be serving from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m.  Last year Gorat’s,  which seats 240, served 915 dinners on Shareholder Sunday.  The three-day total was 2,487 including 656 T-bone steaks, the entrée preferred by the cognoscenti.  Please remember that to come to Gorat’s on th at day, you must have a reservation.  To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 1
st (but not before).   
 
 We will again have a reception at 4 p.m. on Satu rday afternoon for shareholders who have come from outside of North America.  Every year our meeting draws many people from around the globe, and Charlie and I want to be sure we personally greet those who have come so far.  Last year we enjoyed meeting more than 400 of you from many dozens of countries.  Any shareholder who comes from other than the U.S. or Canada will be given a special cred ential and instructions for attending this function. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 At 84 and 77, Charlie and I remain lucky beyond our dreams.  We were born in America; had terrific parents who saw that we got good educations; have enjoyed wonderful families and great health; and came equipped with a “business” gene that allows us to prosper in a manner hugely disproportionate to that experienced by many people who contribute as much or more to our society’s well-being.  Moreover, we have long had jobs that we love, in which we are helped in countless ways by talented and cheerful associates.  Every day is exciting to us; no wonder we tap-dance to work.  But nothing is more fun for us than getting together with our shareholder-partners at Berkshire’s annual meeting.  So join us on May 3
rd at the Qwest for our annual Woodstock for Capitalists.  We’ll see you there.

In all other respects, the results are calculated usingthe numbers originally reported.The S&P 500 numbers arepre-taxwhereas the Berkshire numbers areafter-tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the indexshowed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.

BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:Ourdecreasein net worth during 2008 was $11.5 billion, which reduced the per-share book value ofboth our Class A and Class B stock by 9.6%. Over the last 44 years (that is, since present management took over)book value has grown from $19 to $70,530, a rate of 20.3% compounded annually.*The table on the preceding page, recording both the 44-year performance of Berkshire’s book valueand the S&P 500 index, shows that 2008 was the worst year for each. The period was devastating as well forcorporate and municipal bonds, real estate and commodities. By yearend, investors of all stripes were bloodiedand confused, much as if they were small birds that had strayed into a badminton game.As the year progressed, a series of life-threatening problems within many of the world’s great financialinstitutions was unveiled. This led to a dysfunctional credit market that in important respects soon turnednon-functional. The watchword throughout the country became the creed I saw on restaurant walls when I wasyoung: “In God we trust; all others pay cash.”By the fourth quarter, the credit crisis, coupled with tumbling home and stock prices, had produced aparalyzing fear that engulfed the country. A freefall in business activity ensued, accelerating at a pace that I havenever before witnessed. The U.S. – and much of the world – became trapped in a vicious negative-feedbackcycle. Fear led to business contraction, and that in turn led to even greater fear.This debilitating spiral has spurred our government to take massive action. In poker terms, the Treasuryand the Fed have gone “all in.” Economic medicine that was previously meted out by the cupful has recentlybeen dispensed by the barrel. These once-unthinkable dosages will almost certainly bring on unwelcomeaftereffects. Their precise nature is anyone’s guess, though one likely consequence is an onslaught of inflation.Moreover, major industries have become dependent on Federal assistance, and they will be followed by citiesand states bearing mind-boggling requests. Weaning these entities from the public teat will be a politicalchallenge. They won’t leave willingly.Whatever the downsides may be, strong and immediate action by government was essential last year ifthe financial system was to avoid a total breakdown. Had one occurred, the consequences for every area of oureconomy would have been cataclysmic. Like it or not, the inhabitants of Wall Street, Main Street and the variousSide Streets of America were all in the same boat.Amid this bad news, however, never forget that our country has faced far worse travails in the past. Inthe 20
thCentury alone, we dealt with two great wars (one of which we initially appeared to be losing); a dozen orso panics and recessions; virulent inflation that led to a 21
1⁄2% prime rate in 1980; and the Great Depression of the 1930s, when unemployment ranged between 15% and 25% for many years. America has had no shortage ofchallenges.Without fail, however, we’ve overcome them. In the face of those obstacles – and many others – thereal standard of living for Americans improved nearly seven-fold during the 1900s, while the Dow Jones Industrials rose from 66 to 11,497. Compare the record of this period with the dozens of centuries during whichhumans secured only tiny gains, if any, in how they lived. Though the path has not been smooth, our economicsystem has worked extraordinarily well over time. It has unleashed human potential as no other system has, and itwill continue to do so. America’s best days lie ahead.

Take a look again at the 44-year table on page 2. In 75% of those years, the S&P stocks recorded again. I would guess that a roughly similar percentage of years will be positive in the next 44. But neither CharlieMunger, my partner in running Berkshire, nor I can predict the winning and losing years in advance. (In ourusual opinionated view, we don’t think anyone else can either.) We’re certain, for example, that the economy willbe in shambles throughout 2009 – and, for that matter, probably well beyond – but that conclusion does not tellus whether the stock market will rise or fall.In good years and bad, Charlie and I simply focus on four goals:(1) maintaining Berkshire’s Gibraltar-like financial position, which features huge amounts ofexcess liquidity, near-term obligations that are modest, and dozens of sources of earningsand cash;(2) widening the “moats” around our operating businesses that give them durable competitiveadvantages;(3) acquiring and developing new and varied streams of earnings;(4) expanding and nurturing the cadre of outstanding operating managers who, over the years,have delivered Berkshire exceptional results.Berkshire in 2008Most of the Berkshire businesses whose results are significantly affected by the economy earned belowtheir potential last year, and that will be true in 2009 as well. Our retailers were hit particularly hard, as were ouroperations tied to residential construction. In aggregate, however, our manufacturing, service and retailbusinesses earned substantial sums and most of them – particularly the larger ones – continue to strengthen theircompetitive positions. Moreover, we are fortunate that Berkshire’s two most important businesses – ourinsurance and utility groups – produce earnings that are not correlated to those of the general economy. Bothbusinesses delivered outstanding results in 2008 and have excellent prospects.As predicted in last year’s report, the exceptional underwriting profits that our insurance businessesrealized in 2007 were not repeated in 2008. Nevertheless, the insurance group delivered an underwriting gain forthe sixth consecutive year. This means that our $58.5 billion of insurance “float” – money that doesn’t belong tous but that we hold and invest for our own benefit – cost us less than zero. In fact, we were paid$2.8 billion to hold our float during 2008. Charlie and I find this enjoyable.Over time, most insurers experience a substantial underwriting loss, which makes their economics fardifferent from ours. Of course, we too will experience underwriting losses in some years. But we have the bestgroup of managers in the insurance business, and in most cases they oversee entrenched and valuable franchises.Considering these strengths, I believe that we will earn an underwriting profit over the years and that our floatwill therefore cost us nothing. Our insurance operation, the core business of Berkshire, is an economicpowerhouse.Charlie and I are equally enthusiastic about our utility business, which had record earnings last yearand is poised for future gains. Dave Sokol and Greg Abel, the managers of this operation, have achieved resultsunmatched elsewhere in the utility industry. I love it when they come up with new projects because in thiscapital-intensive business these ventures are often large. Such projects offer Berkshire the opportunity to put outsubstantial sums at decent returns.

Things also went well on the capital-allocation front last year. Berkshire is always a buyer of bothbusinesses and securities, and the disarray in markets gave us a tailwind in our purchases. When investing,pessimism is your friend, euphoria the enemy.In our insurance portfolios, we made three large investments on terms that would be unavailable innormal markets. These should add about $1
1⁄2billion pre-tax to Berkshire’s annual earnings and offer possibilities for capital gains as well. We also closed on our Marmon acquisition (we own 64% of the companynow and will purchase its remaining stock over the next six years). Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries made“tuck-in” acquisitions that will strengthen their competitive positions and earnings.That’s the good news. But there’s another less pleasant reality: During 2008 I did some dumb things ininvestments. I made at least one major mistake of commission and several lesser ones that also hurt. I will tellyou more about these later. Furthermore, I made some errors of omission, sucking my thumb when new factscame in that should have caused me to re-examine my thinking and promptly take action.Additionally, the market value of the bonds and stocks that we continue to hold suffered a significantdecline along with the general market. This does not bother Charlie and me. Indeed, we enjoy such price declinesif we have funds available to increase our positions. Long ago, Ben Graham taught me that “Price is what youpay; value is what you get.” Whether we’re talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandisewhen it is marked down.YardsticksBerkshire has two major areas of value. The first is our investments: stocks, bonds and cashequivalents. At yearend those totaled $122 billion (not counting the investments held by our finance and utilityoperations, which we assign to our second bucket of value). About $58.5 billion of that total is funded by ourinsurance float.Berkshire’s second component of value is earnings that come from sources other than investments andinsurance. These earnings are delivered by our 67 non-insurance companies, itemized on page 96. We excludeour insurance earnings from this calculation because the value of our insurance operation comes from theinvestable funds it generates, and we have already included this factor in our first bucket.In 2008, our investments fell from $90,343 per share of Berkshire (after minority interest) to $77,793, adecrease that was caused by a decline in market prices, not by net sales of stocks or bonds. Our second segmentof value fell from pre-tax earnings of $4,093 per Berkshire share to $3,921 (again after minority interest).Both of these performances are unsatisfactory. Over time, we need to make decent gains in each area ifwe are to increase Berkshire’s intrinsic value at an acceptable rate. Going forward, however, our focus will be onthe earnings segment, just as it has been for several decades. We like buying underpriced securities, but we likebuying fairly-priced operating businesses even more.Now, let’s take a look at the four major operating sectors of Berkshire. Each of these has vastlydifferent balance sheet and income account characteristics. Therefore, lumping them together, as is done instandard financial statements, impedes analysis. So we’ll present them as four separate businesses, which is howCharlie and I view them.

Regulated Utility BusinessBerkshire has an 87.4% (diluted) interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which owns a widevariety of utility operations. The largest of these are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, whose3.8 million end users make it the U.K.’s third largest distributor of electricity; (2) MidAmerican Energy, whichserves 723,000 electric customers, primarily in Iowa; (3) Pacific Power and Rocky Mountain Power, servingabout 1.7 million electric customers in six western states; and (4) Kern River and Northern Natural pipelines,which carry about 9% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S.Our partners in ownership of MidAmerican are its two terrific managers, Dave Sokol and Greg Abel,and my long-time friend, Walter Scott. It’s unimportant how many votes each party has; we make major movesonly when we are unanimous in thinking them wise. Nine years of working with Dave, Greg and Walter havereinforced my original belief: Berkshire couldn’t have better partners.Somewhat incongruously, MidAmerican also owns the second largest real estate brokerage firm in theU.S., HomeServices of America. This company operates through 21 locally-branded firms that have 16,000agents. Last year was a terrible year for home sales, and 2009 looks no better. We will continue, however, toacquire quality brokerage operations when they are available at sensible prices.Here are some key figures on MidAmerican’s operations: Earnings (in millions)

Here’s some backup for that claim.Our two pipelines, Kern River and Northern Natural, were both acquired in 2002. A firm called Mastioregularly ranks pipelines for customer satisfaction. Among the 44 rated, Kern River came in 9
thwhen we purchased it and Northern Natural ranked 39
th. There was work to do.In Mastio’s 2009 report, Kern River ranked 1
stand Northern Natural 3rd. Charlie and I couldn’t be more proud of this performance. It came about because hundreds of people at each operation committed themselves toa new culture and then delivered on their commitment.Achievements at our electric utilities have been equally impressive. In 1995, MidAmerican became themajor provider of electricity in Iowa. By judicious planning and a zeal for efficiency, the company has keptelectric prices unchanged since our purchase and has promised to hold them steady through 2013. 6MidAmerican has maintained this extraordinary price stability while making Iowa number one amongall states in the percentage of its generation capacity that comes from wind. Since our purchase, MidAmerican’swind-based facilities have grown from zero to almost 20% of total capacity.Similarly, when we purchased PacifiCorp in 2006, we moved aggressively to expand wind generation.Wind capacity was then 33 megawatts. It’s now 794, with more coming. (Arriving at PacifiCorp, we found“wind” of a different sort: The company had 98 committees that met frequently. Now there are 28. Meanwhile,we generate and deliver considerably more electricity, doing so with 2% fewer employees.)In 2008 alone, MidAmerican spent $1.8 billion on wind generation at our two operations, and today thecompany is number one in the nation among regulated utilities in ownership of wind capacity. By the way,compare that $1.8 billion to the $1.1 billion of pre-tax earnings of PacifiCorp (shown in the table as “Western”)and Iowa. In our utility business, we spend all we earn, and then some, in order to fulfill the needs of our serviceareas. Indeed, MidAmerican has not paid a dividend since Berkshire bought into the company in early 2000. Itsearnings have instead been reinvested to develop the utility systems our customers require and deserve. Inexchange, we have been allowed to earn a fair return on the huge sums we have invested. It’s a great partnershipfor all concerned.************Our long-avowed goal is to be the “buyer of choice” for businesses – particularly those built and ownedby families. The way to achieve this goal is to deserve it. That means we must keep our promises; avoidleveraging up acquired businesses; grant unusual autonomy to our managers; and hold the purchased companiesthrough thick and thin (though we prefer thick and thicker).Our record matches our rhetoric. Most buyers competing against us, however, follow a different path.For them, acquisitions are “merchandise.” Before the ink dries on their purchase contracts, these operators arecontemplating “exit strategies.” We have a decided advantage, therefore, when we encounter sellers who trulycare about the future of their businesses.Some years back our competitors were known as “leveraged-buyout operators.” But LBO became abad name. So in Orwellian fashion, the buyout firms decided to change their moniker. What they did not change,though, were the essential ingredients of their previous operations, including their cherished fee structures andlove of leverage.Their new label became “private equity,” a name that turns the facts upside-down: A purchase of abusiness by these firms almost invariably results in dramatic reductionsin the equity portion of the acquiree’s capital structure compared to that previously existing. A number of these acquirees, purchased only two to threeyears ago, are now in mortal danger because of the debt piled on them by their private-equity buyers. Much ofthe bank debt is selling below 70¢ on the dollar, and the public debt has taken a far greater beating. The private-equity firms, it should be noted, are not rushing in to inject the equity their wards now desperately need. Instead,they’re keeping their remaining fundsveryprivate.In the regulated utility field there are no large family-owned businesses. Here, Berkshire hopes to bethe “buyer of choice” ofregulators. It is they, rather than selling shareholders, who judge the fitness ofpurchasers when transactions are proposed.There is no hiding your history when you stand before these regulators. They can – and do – call theircounterparts in other states where you operate and ask how you have behaved in respect to all aspects of thebusiness, including a willingness to commit adequate equity capital.

When MidAmerican proposed its purchase of PacifiCorp in 2005, regulators in the six new states wewould be serving immediately checked our record in Iowa. They also carefully evaluated our financing plans andcapabilities. We passed this examination, just as we expect to pass future ones.There are two reasons for our confidence. First, Dave Sokol and Greg Abel are going to run anybusinesses with which they are associated in a first-class manner. They don’t know of any other way to operate.Beyond that is the fact that we hope to buy more regulated utilities in the future – and we know that our businessbehavior in jurisdictions where we are operating today will determine how we are welcomed by new jurisdictionstomorrow.InsuranceOur insurance group has propelled Berkshire’s growth since we first entered the business in 1967. Thishappy result has not been due to general prosperity in the industry. During the 25 years ending in 2007, return onnet worth for insurers averaged 8.5% versus 14.0% for the Fortune 500. Clearly our insurance CEOs have nothad the wind at their back. Yet these managers have excelled to a degree Charlie and I never dreamed possible inthe early days. Why do I love them? Let me count the ways.At GEICO, Tony Nicely – now in his 48th year at the company after joining it when he was 18 –continues to gobble up market share while maintaining disciplined underwriting. When Tony became CEO in1993, GEICO had 2.0% of the auto insurance market, a level at which the company had long been stuck. Now wehave a 7.7% share, up from 7.2% in 2007.The combination of new business gains and an improvement in the renewal rate on existing businesshas moved GEICO into the number three position among auto insurers. In 1995, when Berkshire purchasedcontrol, GEICO was number seven. Now we trail only State Farm and Allstate.GEICO grows because it saves money for motorists. No one likesto buy auto insurance. But virtually everyone likes to drive. So, sensibly, drivers look for the lowest-cost insurance consistent with first-class service.Efficiency is the key to low cost, and efficiency is Tony’s specialty. Five years ago the number of policies peremployee was 299. In 2008, the number was 439, a huge increase in productivity.As we view GEICO’s current opportunities, Tony and I feel like two hungry mosquitoes in a nudistcamp. Juicy targets are everywhere. First, and most important, our new business in auto insurance is nowexploding. Americans are focused on saving money as never before, and they are flocking to GEICO. In January2009, we set a monthly record – by a wide margin – for growth in policyholders. That record will last exactly 28days: As we go to press, it’s clear February’s gain will be even better.Beyond this, we are gaining ground in allied lines. Last year, our motorcycle policies increased by23.4%, which raised our market share from about 6% to more than 7%. Our RV and ATV businesses are alsogrowing rapidly, albeit from a small base. And, finally, we recently began insuring commercial autos, a bigmarket that offers real promise.GEICO is now saving money for millions of Americans. Go to GEICO.com or call 1-800-847-7536and see if we can save you money as well.General Re, our large international reinsurer, also had an outstanding year in 2008. Some time back,the company had serious problems (which I totally failed to detect when we purchased it in late 1998). By 2001,when Joe Brandon took over as CEO, assisted by his partner, Tad Montross, General Re’s culture had furtherdeteriorated, exhibiting a loss of discipline in underwriting, reserving and expenses. After Joe and Tad tookcharge, these problems were decisively and successfully addressed. Today General Re has regained its luster.Last spring Joe stepped down, and Tad became CEO. Charlie and I are grateful to Joe for righting the ship andare certain that, with Tad, General Re’s future is in the best of hands.8Reinsurance is a business of long-term promises, sometimes extending for fifty years or more. Thispast year has retaught clients a crucial principle: A promise is no better than the person or institution making it.That’s where General Re excels: It is theonlyreinsurer that is backed by an AAA corporation. Ben Franklin oncesaid, “It’s difficult for an empty sack to stand upright.” That’s no worry for General Re clients.Our third major insurance operation is Ajit Jain’s reinsurance division, headquartered in Stamford andstaffed by only 31 employees. This may be one of the most remarkable businesses in the world, hard tocharacterize but easy to admire.From year to year, Ajit’s business is never the same. It features very large transactions, incrediblespeed of execution and a willingness to quote on policies that leave others scratching their heads. When there is ahuge and unusual risk to be insured, Ajit is almost certain to be called.Ajit came to Berkshire in 1986. Very quickly, I realized that we had acquired an extraordinary talent.So I did the logical thing: I wrote his parents in New Delhi and asked if they had another one like him at home.Of course, I knew the answer before writing. There isn’tanyone like Ajit.Our smaller insurers are just as outstanding in their own way as the “big three,” regularly deliveringvaluable float to us at a negative cost. We aggregate their results below under “Other Primary.” For spacereasons, we don’t discuss these insurers individually. But be assured that Charlie and I appreciate thecontribution of each.Here is the record for the four legs to our insurance stool. The underwriting profits signify that all fourprovided funds to Berkshire last year without cost, just as they did in 2007. And in both years our underwritingprofitability was considerably better than that achieved by the industry. Of course, we ourselves will periodicallyhave a terrible year in insurance. But, overall, I expect us to averagean underwriting profit. If so, we will be using free funds of large size for the indefinite future. Underwriting Profit

*Does not include purchase-accounting adjustments.This motley group, which sells products ranging from lollipops to motor homes, earned an impressive17.9% on average tangible net worth last year. It’s also noteworthy that these operations used only minorfinancial leverage in achieving that return. Clearly we own some terrific businesses. We purchased many ofthem, however, at large premiums to net worth – a point reflected in the goodwill item shown on our balancesheet – and that fact reduces the earnings on our average carryingvalue to 8.1%. Though the full-year result was satisfactory, earnings of many of the businesses in this group hit theskids in last year’s fourth quarter. Prospects for 2009 look worse. Nevertheless, the group retains strong earningpower even under today’s conditions and will continue to deliver significant cash to the parent company. Overall,these companies improved their competitive positions last year, partly because our financial strength let us makeadvantageous tuck-in acquisitions. In contrast, many competitors were treading water (or sinking).The most noteworthy of these acquisitions was Iscar’s late-November purchase of Tungaloy, a leadingJapanese producer of small tools. Charlie and I continue to look with astonishment – and appreciation! – at theaccomplishments of Iscar’s management. To secure one manager like Eitan Wertheimer, Jacob Harpaz or DannyGoldman when we acquire a company is a blessing. Getting three is like winning the Triple Crown. Iscar’sgrowth since our purchase has exceeded our expectations – which were high – and the addition of Tungaloy willmove performance to the next level.MiTek, Benjamin Moore, Acme Brick, Forest River, Marmon and CTB also made one or moreacquisitions during the year. CTB, which operates worldwide in the agriculture equipment field, has now pickedup six small firms since we purchased it in 2002. At that time, we paid $140 million for the company. Last yearits pre-tax earnings were $89 million. Vic Mancinelli, its CEO, followed Berkshire-like operating principles longbefore our arrival. He focuses on blocking and tackling, day by day doing the little things right and never gettingoff course. Ten years from now, Vic will be running a much larger operation and, more important, will beearning excellent returns on invested capital.Finance and Financial ProductsI will write here at some length about the mortgage operation of Clayton Homes and skip any financialcommentary, which is summarized in the table at the end of this section. I do this because Clayton’s recentexperience may be useful in the public-policy debate about housing and mortgages. But first a little background.Clayton is the largest company in the manufactured home industry, delivering 27,499 units last year.This came to about 34% of the industry’s 81,889 total. Our share will likely grow in 2009, partly because muchof the rest of the industry is in acute distress. Industrywide, units sold have steadily declined since they hit a peakof 372,843 in 1998.

10

At that time, much of the industry employed sales practices that were atrocious. Writing about theperiod somewhat later, I described it as involving “borrowers who shouldn’t have borrowed being financed bylenders who shouldn’t have lent.”To begin with, the need for meaningful down payments was frequently ignored. Sometimes fakery wasinvolved. (“That certainly looks like a $2,000 cat to me” says the salesman who will receive a $3,000commission if the loan goes through.) Moreover, impossible-to-meet monthly payments were being agreed to byborrowers who signed up because they had nothing to lose. The resulting mortgages were usually packaged(“securitized”) and sold by Wall Street firms to unsuspecting investors. This chain of folly had to end badly, andit did.Clayton, it should be emphasized, followed far more sensible practices in its own lending throughoutthat time. Indeed, no purchaser of the mortgages it originated and then securitized has ever lost a dime ofprincipal or interest. But Clayton was the exception; industry losses were staggering. And the hangover continuesto this day.This 1997-2000 fiasco should have served as a canary-in-the-coal-mine warning for the far-largerconventional housing market. But investors, government and rating agencies learned exactly nothing from themanufactured-home debacle. Instead, in an eerie rerun of that disaster, the same mistakes were repeated withconventional homes in the 2004-07 period: Lenders happily made loans that borrowers couldn’t repay out of theirincomes, and borrowers just as happily signed up to meet those payments. Both parties counted on “house-priceappreciation” to make this otherwise impossible arrangement work. It was Scarlett O’Hara all over again: “I’llthink about it tomorrow.” The consequences of this behavior are now reverberating through every corner of oureconomy.Clayton’s 198,888 borrowers, however, have continued to pay normally throughout the housing crash,handing us no unexpected losses. This isnotbecause these borrowers are unusually creditworthy, a point provedby FICO scores (a standard measure of credit risk). Their median FICO score is 644, compared to a nationalmedian of 723, and about 35% are below 620, the segment usually designated “sub-prime.” Many disastrouspools of mortgages on conventional homes are populated by borrowers with far better credit, as measured byFICO scores.Yet at yearend, our delinquency rate on loans we have originated was 3.6%, up only modestly from2.9% in 2006 and 2.9% in 2004. (In addition to our originated loans, we’ve also bought bulk portfolios of varioustypes from other financial institutions.) Clayton’s foreclosures during 2008 were 3.0% of originated loanscompared to 3.8% in 2006 and 5.3% in 2004.Why are our borrowers – characteristically people with modest incomes and far-from-great creditscores – performing so well? The answer is elementary, going right back to Lending 101. Our borrowers simplylooked at how full-bore mortgage payments would compare with their actual – not hoped-for – income and thendecided whether they could live with that commitment. Simply put, they took out a mortgage with the intentionof paying it off, whatever the course of home prices.Just as important is what our borrowers didnotdo. They did not count on making their loan payments by means of refinancing. They did not sign up for “teaser” rates that upon reset were outsized relative to theirincome. And they did not assume that they could always sell their home at a profit if their mortgage paymentsbecame onerous. Jimmy Stewart would have loved these folks.Of course, a number of our borrowers will run into trouble. They generally have no more than minorsavings to tide them over if adversity hits. The major cause of delinquency or foreclosure is the loss of a job, butdeath, divorce and medical expenses all cause problems. If unemployment rates rise – as they surely will in2009 – more of Clayton’s borrowers will have troubles, and we will have larger, though still manageable, losses.But our problems will not be driven to any extent by the trend of home prices.11Commentary about the current housing crisis often ignores the crucial fact that most foreclosures donotoccur because a house is worth less than its mortgage (so-called “upside-down” loans). Rather, foreclosurestake place because borrowers can’t pay the monthly payment that they agreed to pay. Homeowners who havemade a meaningful down-payment – derived from savings and not from other borrowing – seldom walk awayfrom a primary residence simply because its value today is less than the mortgage. Instead, they walk when theycan’t make the monthly payments.Home ownership is a wonderful thing. My family and I have enjoyed my present home for 50 years,with more to come. But enjoyment and utility should be the primary motives for purchase, not profit or refipossibilities. And the home purchased ought to fit the income of the purchaser.The present housing debacle should teach home buyers, lenders, brokers and government some simplelessons that will ensure stability in the future. Home purchases should involve an honest-to-God down paymentof at least 10% and monthly payments that can be comfortably handled by the borrower’s income. That incomeshould be carefully verified.Putting people into homes, though a desirable goal, shouldn’t be our country’s primary objective.Keeping them in their homes should be the ambition.************Clayton’s lending operation, though not damaged by the performance of its borrowers, is neverthelessthreatened by an element of the credit crisis. Funders that have access to any sort of government guarantee –banks with FDIC-insured deposits, large entities with commercial paper now backed by the Federal Reserve, andothers who are using imaginative methods (or lobbying skills) to come under the government’s umbrella – havemoney costs that are minimal. Conversely, highly-rated companies, such as Berkshire, are experiencingborrowing costs that, in relation to Treasury rates, are at record levels. Moreover, funds are abundant for thegovernment-guaranteed borrower but often scarce for others, no matter how creditworthy they may be.This unprecedented “spread” in the cost of money makes it unprofitable for any lender who doesn’tenjoy government-guaranteed funds to go up against those with a favored status. Government is determining the“haves” and “have-nots.” That is why companies are rushing to convert to bank holding companies, not a coursefeasible for Berkshire.Though Berkshire’s credit is pristine – we are one of only seven AAA corporations in the country – ourcost of borrowing is nowfarhigher than competitors with shaky balance sheets but government backing. At themoment, it is much better to be a financial cripple with a government guarantee than a Gibraltar without one.Today’s extreme conditions may soon end. At worst, we believe we will find at least a partial solutionthat will allow us to continue much of Clayton’s lending. Clayton’s earnings, however, will surely suffer if weare forced to compete for long against government-favored lenders. Pre-Tax Earnings

BHAC insures these securities for issuers bothat the time their bonds are sold to the public (primary transactions) and later, when the bonds are already ownedby investors (secondary transactions).By yearend 2007, the half dozen or so companies that had been the major players in this business hadall fallen into big trouble. The cause of their problems was captured long ago by Mae West: “I was Snow White,but I drifted.”The monolines (as the bond insurers are called) initially insured only tax-exempt bonds that werelow-risk. But over the years competition for this business intensified, and rates fell. Faced with the prospect ofstagnating or declining earnings, the monoline managers turned to ever-riskier propositions. Some of theseinvolved the insuring of residential mortgage obligations. When housing prices plummeted, the monolineindustry quickly became a basket case.Early in the year, Berkshire offered to assume all of the insurance issued on tax-exempts that was onthe books of the three largest monolines. These companies were all in life-threatening trouble (though they saidotherwise.) We would have charged a 1
1⁄2% rate to take over the guarantees on about $822 billion of bonds. Ifour offer had been accepted, we would have been required to pay any losses suffered by investors who ownedthese bonds – a guarantee stretching for 40 years in some cases. Ours was not a frivolous proposal: For reasonswe will come to later, it involved substantial risk for Berkshire.The monolines summarily rejected our offer, in some cases appending an insult or two. In the end,though, the turndowns proved to beverygood news for us, because it became apparent that I had severelyunderpriced our offer.Thereafter, we wrote about $15.6 billion of insurance in the secondary market. And here’s the punchline: About 77% of this business was on bonds that were already insured, largely by the three aforementionedmonolines. In these agreements, we have to pay for defaults onlyif the original insurer is financially unable to do so.We wrote this “second-to-pay” insurance for rates averaging 3.3%. That’s right; we have been paid farmore for becoming the second to pay than the 1.5% we would have earlier charged to be the first to pay. In oneextreme case, we actually agreed to befourthto pay, nonetheless receiving about three times the 1% premiumcharged by the monoline that remainsfirstto pay. In other words, three other monolines have to first go brokebefore we need to write a check.Two of the three monolines to which we made our initial bulk offer later raised substantial capital.This, of course, directly helpsus, since it makes it less likely that we will have to pay, at least in the near term,any claims on our second-to-pay insurance because these two monolines fail. In addition to our book ofsecondary business, we have also written $3.7 billion of primary business for a premium of $96 million. Inprimary business, of course, we are first to pay if the issuer gets in trouble.We have a great many more multiples of capital behind the insurance we write than does any othermonoline. Consequently, our guarantee is far more valuable than theirs. This explains why many sophisticatedinvestors have bought second-to-pay insurance from us even though they were already insured by anothermonoline. BHAC has become not only the insurer of preference, but in many cases the soleinsurer acceptable to bondholders.Nevertheless, we remain very cautious about the business we write and regard it as far from a surething that this insurance will ultimately be profitable for us. The reason is simple, though I have never seen evena passing reference to it by any financial analyst, rating agency or monoline CEO.13The rationale behind very low premium rates for insuring tax-exempts has been that defaults havehistorically been few. But that record largely reflects the experience of entities that issued uninsuredbonds. Insurance of tax-exempt bonds didn’t exist before 1971, and even after that most bonds remained uninsured.A universe of tax-exempts fully covered by insurance would be certain to have a somewhat differentloss experience from a group of uninsured, but otherwise similar bonds, the only question being howdifferent. To understand why, let’s go back to 1975 when New York City was on the edge of bankruptcy. At the time itsbonds – virtually all uninsured – were heavily held by the city’s wealthier residents as well as by New Yorkbanks and other institutions. These local bondholders deeply desired to solve the city’s fiscal problems. So beforelong, concessions and cooperation from a host of involved constituencies produced a solution. Without one, itwas apparent to all that New York’s citizens and businesses would have experienced widespread and severefinancial losses from their bond holdings.Now, imagine that all of the city’s bonds had instead been insured by Berkshire. Would similar belt-tightening, tax increases, labor concessions, etc. have been forthcoming? Of course not. At a minimum, Berkshirewould have been asked to “share” in the required sacrifices. And, considering our deep pockets, the requiredcontribution would most certainly have been substantial.Local governments are going to facefartougher fiscal problems in the future than they have to date. The pension liabilities I talked about in last year’s report will be a huge contributor to these woes. Many citiesand states were surely horrified when they inspected the status of their funding at yearend 2008. The gap betweenassets and a realistic actuarial valuation of present liabilities is simply staggering.When faced with large revenue shortfalls, communities that have all of their bonds insured will bemore prone to develop “solutions” less favorable to bondholders than those communities that have uninsuredbonds held by local banks and residents. Losses in the tax-exempt arena, when they come, are also likely to behighly correlated among issuers. If a few communities stiff their creditors and get away with it, the chance thatothers will follow in their footsteps will grow. What mayor or city council is going to choose pain to localcitizens in the form of major tax increases over pain to a far-away bond insurer?Insuring tax-exempts, therefore, has the look today of a dangerous business – one with similarities, infact, to the insuring of natural catastrophes. In both cases, a string of loss-free years can be followed by adevastating experience that more than wipes out all earlier profits. We will try, therefore, to proceed carefully inthis business, eschewing many classes of bonds that other monolines regularly embrace.************The type of fallacy involved in projecting loss experience from a universe of non-insured bonds onto adeceptively-similar universe in which many bonds are insured pops up in other areas of finance. “Back-tested”models of many kinds are susceptible to this sort of error. Nevertheless, they are frequently touted in financialmarkets as guides to future action. (If merely looking up past financial data would tell you what the future holds,the Forbes 400 would consist of librarians.)Indeed, the stupefying losses in mortgage-related securities came in large part because of flawed,history-based models used by salesmen, rating agencies and investors. These parties looked at loss experienceover periods when home prices rose only moderately and speculation in houses was negligible. They then madethis experience a yardstick for evaluating future losses. They blissfully ignored the fact that house prices hadrecently skyrocketed, loan practices had deteriorated and many buyers had opted for houses they couldn’t afford.In short, universe “past” and universe “current” had very different characteristics. But lenders, government andmedia largely failed to recognize this all-important fact.

Investors should be skeptical of history-based models. Constructed by a nerdy-sounding priesthoodusing esoteric terms such as beta, gamma, sigma and the like, these models tend to look impressive. Too often,though, investors forget to examine the assumptions behind the symbols. Our advice: Beware of geeks bearingformulas.************A final post-script on BHAC: Who, you may wonder, runs this operation? While I help set policy, allof the heavy lifting is done by Ajit and his crew. Sure, they were already generating $24 billion of float alongwith hundreds of millions of underwriting profit annually. But how busy can that keep a 31-person group?Charlie and I decided it was high time for them to start doing a full day’s work.InvestmentsBecause of accounting rules, we divide our large holdings of common stocks this year into twocategories.

*This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP “cost” differs in a few cases because ofwrite-ups or write-downs that have been required.In addition, we have holdings in Moody’s and Burlington Northern Santa Fe that we now carry at“equity value” – our cost plus retained earnings since our purchase, minus the tax that would be paid if thoseearnings were paid to us as dividends. This accounting treatment is usually required when ownership of aninvestee company reaches 20%.We purchased 15% of Moody’s some years ago and have not since bought a share. Moody’s, though,has repurchased its own shares and, by late 2008, those repurchases reduced its outstanding shares to the pointthat our holdings rose above 20%. Burlington Northern has also repurchased shares, but our increase to 20%primarily occurred because we continued to buy this stock.

Unless facts or rules change, you will see these holdings reflected in our balance sheet at “equityaccounting” values, whatever their market prices. You will also see our share of their earnings (less applicabletaxes) regularly included in our quarterly and annual earnings.I told you in an earlier part of this report that last year I made a major mistake of commission (andmaybe more; this one sticks out). Without urging from Charlie or anyone else, I bought a large amount ofConocoPhillips stock when oil and gas prices were near their peak. I in no way anticipated the dramatic fall inenergy prices that occurred in the last half of the year. I still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher inthe future than the current $40-$50 price. But so far I have been dead wrong. Even if prices should rise,moreover, the terrible timing of my purchase has cost Berkshire several billion dollars.I made some other already-recognizable errors as well. They were smaller, but unfortunately not that small. During 2008, I spent $244 million for shares of two Irish banks that appeared cheap to me. At yearend wewrote these holdings down to market: $27 million, for an 89% loss. Since then, the two stocks have declinedeven further. The tennis crowd would call my mistakes “unforced errors.”On the plus side last year, we made purchases totaling $14.5 billion in fixed-income securities issuedby Wrigley, Goldman Sachs and General Electric. We very much like these commitments, which carry highcurrent yields that, in themselves, make the investments more than satisfactory. But in each of these threepurchases, we also acquired a substantial equity participation as a bonus. To fund these large purchases, I had tosell portions of some holdings that I would have preferred to keep (primarily Johnson & Johnson, Procter &Gamble and ConocoPhillips). However, I have pledged – to you, the rating agencies and myself – to always runBerkshire with more than ample cash. We never want to count on the kindness of strangers in order to meettomorrow’s obligations. When forced to choose, I will not trade even a night’s sleep for the chance of extraprofits.The investment world has gone from underpricing risk to overpricing it. This change has not beenminor; the pendulum has covered an extraordinary arc. A few years ago, it would have seemed unthinkable thatyields like today’s could have been obtained on good-grade municipal or corporate bonds even while risk-freegovernments offered near-zero returns on short-term bonds and no better than a pittance on long-terms. When thefinancial history of this decade is written, it will surely speak of the Internet bubble of the late 1990s and thehousing bubble of the early 2000s. But the U.S. Treasury bond bubble of late 2008 may be regarded as almostequally extraordinary.Clinging to cash equivalents or long-term government bonds at present yields is almost certainly aterrible policy if continued for long. Holders of these instruments, of course, have felt increasingly comfortable –in fact, almost smug – in following this policy as financial turmoil has mounted. They regard their judgmentconfirmed when they hear commentators proclaim “cash is king,” even though that wonderful cash is earningclose to nothing and will surely find its purchasing power eroded over time.Approval, though, is not the goal of investing. In fact, approval is often counter-productive because itsedates the brain and makes it less receptive to new facts or a re-examination of conclusions formed earlier.Beware the investment activity that produces applause; the great moves are usually greeted by yawns.DerivativesDerivatives are dangerous. They have dramatically increased the leverage and risks in our financialsystem. They have made it almost impossible for investors to understand and analyze our largest commercialbanks and investment banks. They allowed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to engage in massive misstatements ofearnings for years. So indecipherable were Freddie and Fannie that their federal regulator, OFHEO, whose morethan 100 employees had no job except the oversight of these two institutions, totally missed their cooking of thebooks.

Indeed, recent events demonstrate that certain big-name CEOs (or former CEOs) at major financialinstitutions were simply incapable of managing a business with a huge, complex book of derivatives. IncludeCharlie and me in this hapless group: When Berkshire purchased General Re in 1998, we knew we could not getour minds around its book of 23,218 derivatives contracts, made with 884 counterparties (many of which we hadnever heard of). So we decided to close up shop. Though we were under no pressure and were operating inbenign markets as we exited, it took us five years and more than $400 million in losses to largely complete thetask. Upon leaving, our feelings about the business mirrored a line in a country song: “I liked you better before Igot to know you so well.”Improved “transparency” – a favorite remedy of politicians, commentators and financial regulators foraverting future train wrecks – won’t cure the problems that derivatives pose. I know of no reporting mechanismthat would come close to describing and measuring the risks in a huge and complex portfolio of derivatives.Auditors can’t audit these contracts, and regulators can’t regulate them. When I read the pages of “disclosure” in10-Ks of companies that are entangled with these instruments, all I end up knowing is that I don’tknow what is going on in their portfolios (and then I reach for some aspirin).For a case study on regulatory effectiveness, let’s look harder at the Freddie and Fannie example.These giant institutions were created by Congress, which retained control over them, dictating what they couldand could not do. To aid its oversight, Congress created OFHEO in 1992, admonishing it to make sure the twobehemoths were behaving themselves. With that move, Fannie and Freddie became the most intensely-regulatedcompanies of which I am aware, as measured by manpower assigned to the task.On June 15, 2003, OFHEO (whose annual reports are available on the Internet) sent its 2002 report toCongress – specifically to its four bosses in the Senate and House, among them none other than Messrs. Sarbanesand Oxley. The report’s 127 pages included a self-congratulatory cover-line: “Celebrating 10 Years ofExcellence.” The transmittal letter and report were delivered nine days afterthe CEO and CFO of Freddie had resigned in disgrace and the COO had been fired. No mention of their departures was made in the letter, evenwhile the report concluded, as it always did, that “Both Enterprises were financially sound and well managed.”In truth, both enterprises had engaged in massive accounting shenanigans for some time. Finally, in2006, OFHEO issued a 340-page scathing chronicle of the sins of Fannie that, more or less, blamed the fiasco onevery party but – you guessed it – Congress and OFHEO.The Bear Stearns collapse highlights the counterparty problem embedded in derivatives transactions, atime bomb I first discussed in Berkshire’s 2002 report. On April 3, 2008, Tim Geithner, then the able president ofthe New York Fed, explained the need for a rescue: “The sudden discovery by Bear’s derivative counterpartiesthat important financial positions they had put in place to protect themselves from financial risk were no longeroperative would have triggered substantial further dislocation in markets. This would have precipitated a rush byBear’s counterparties to liquidate the collateral they held against those positions and to attempt to replicate thosepositions in already very fragile markets.” This is Fedspeak for “We stepped in to avoid a financial chain reactionof unpredictable magnitude.” In my opinion, the Fed was right to do so.A normal stock or bond trade is completed in a few days with one party getting its cash, the other itssecurities. Counterparty risk therefore quickly disappears, which means credit problems can’t accumulate. Thisrapid settlement process is key to maintaining the integrity of markets. That, in fact, is a reason for NYSE andNASDAQshorteningthe settlement period from five days to three days in 1995.Derivatives contracts, in contrast, often go unsettled for years, or even decades, with counterpartiesbuilding up huge claims against each other. “Paper” assets and liabilities – often hard to quantify – becomeimportant parts of financial statements though these items will not be validated for many years. Additionally, afrightening web of mutual dependence develops among huge financial institutions. Receivables and payables bythe billions become concentrated in the hands of a few large dealers who are apt to be highly-leveraged in otherways as well. Participants seeking to dodge troubles face the same problem as someone seeking to avoid venerealdisease: It’s not just whomyousleep with, but also whomtheyare sleeping with.17Sleeping around, to continue our metaphor, can actually be useful for large derivatives dealers becauseit assures them government aid if trouble hits. In other words, only companies having problems that can infectthe entire neighborhood – I won’t mention names – are certain to become a concern of the state (an outcome, I’msad to say, that is proper). From this irritating reality comes The First Law of Corporate Survivalfor ambitious CEOs who pile on leverage and run large and unfathomable derivatives books: Modest incompetence simplywon’t do; it’s mindboggling screw-ups that are required.Considering the ruin I’ve pictured, you may wonder why Berkshire is a party to 251 derivativescontracts (other than those used for operational purposes at MidAmerican and the few left over at Gen Re). Theanswer is simple: I believe each contract we own was mispriced at inception, sometimes dramatically so. I bothinitiated these positions and monitor them, a set of responsibilities consistent with my belief that the CEO of anylarge financial organizationmustbe the Chief Risk Officer as well. If we lose money on our derivatives, it will bemy fault.Our derivatives dealings require our counterparties to make payments to us when contracts areinitiated. Berkshire therefore always holds the money, which leaves us assuming no meaningful counterpartyrisk. As of yearend, the payments made to us less losses we have paid – our derivatives “float,” so to speak –totaled $8.1 billion. This float is similar to insurance float: If we break even on an underlying transaction, we willhave enjoyed the use of free money for a long time. Our expectation, though it is far from a sure thing, is that wewill do better than break even and that the substantial investment income we earn on the funds will be frosting onthe cake.Only a small percentage of our contracts call for any posting of collateral when the market movesagainst us. Even under the chaotic conditions existing in last year’s fourth quarter, we had to post less than 1% ofour securities portfolio. (When we post collateral, we deposit it with third parties, meanwhile retaining theinvestment earnings on the deposited securities.) In our 2002 annual report, we warned of the lethal threat thatposting requirements create, real-life illustrations of which we witnessed last year at a variety of financialinstitutions (and, for that matter, at Constellation Energy, which was within hours of bankruptcy whenMidAmerican arrived to effect a rescue).Our contracts fall into four major categories. With apologies to those who are not fascinated byfinancial instruments, I will explain them in excruciating detail.• We have added modestly to the “equity put” portfolio I described in last year’s report. Some of ourcontracts come due in 15 years, others in 20. We must make a payment to our counterparty atmaturity if the reference index to which the put is tied is then below what it was at the inception ofthe contract. Neither party can elect to settle early; it’s only the price on the final day that counts.To illustrate, we might sell a $1 billion 15-year put contract on the S&P 500 when that index is at,say, 1300. If the index is at 1170 – down 10% – on the day of maturity, we would pay $100 million.If it is above 1300, we owe nothing. For us to lose $1 billion, the index would have to go to zero. Inthe meantime, the sale of the put would have delivered us a premium – perhaps $100 million to$150 million – that we would be free to invest as we wish.Our put contracts total $37.1 billion (at current exchange rates) and are spread among four majorindices: the S&P 500 in the U.S., the FTSE 100 in the U.K., the Euro Stoxx 50 in Europe, and theNikkei 225 in Japan. Our first contract comes due on September 9, 2019 and our last on January 24,2028. We have received premiums of $4.9 billion, money we have invested. We, meanwhile, havepaid nothing, since all expiration dates are far in the future. Nonetheless, we have used Black-Scholes valuation methods to record a yearend liability of $10 billion, an amount that will changeon every reporting date. The two financial items – this estimated loss of $10 billion minus the $4.9billion in premiums we have received – means that we have so far reported a mark-to-market lossof $5.1 billion from these contracts.18We endorse mark-to-market accounting. I will explain later, however, why I believe the Black-Scholes formula, even though it is the standard for establishing the dollar liability for options,produces strange results when the long-term variety are being valued.One point about our contracts that is sometimes not understood: For us to lose the full $37.1 billionwe have at risk, all stocks in all four indices would have to go to zeroon their various termination dates. If, however – as an example – all indices fell 25% from their value at the inception of eachcontract, and foreign-exchange rates remained as they are today, we would owe about $9 billion,payable between 2019 and 2028. Between the inception of the contract and those dates, we wouldhave held the $4.9 billion premium and earned investment income on it.• The second category we described in last year’s report concerns derivatives requiring us to paywhen credit losses occur at companies that are included in various high-yield indices. Our standardcontract covers a five-year period and involves 100 companies. We modestly expanded our positionlast year in this category. But, of course, the contracts on the books at the end of 2007 moved oneyear closer to their maturity. Overall, our contracts now have an average life of 2
1⁄3years, with the first expiration due to occur on September 20, 2009 and the last on December 20, 2013.By yearend we had received premiums of $3.4 billion on these contracts and paid losses of $542million. Using mark-to-market principles, we also set up a liability for future losses that at yearendtotaled $3.0 billion. Thus we had to that point recorded a loss of about $100 million, derived fromour $3.5 billion total in paid and estimated future losses minus the $3.4 billion of premiums wereceived. In our quarterly reports, however, the amount of gain or loss has swung wildly from aprofit of $327 million in the second quarter of 2008 to a loss of $693 million in the fourth quarter of2008.Surprisingly, we made payments on these contracts of only $97 million last year, far below theestimate I used when I decided to enter into them. This year, however, losses have acceleratedsharply with the mushrooming of large bankruptcies. In last year’s letter, I told you I expected thesecontracts to show a profit at expiration. Now, with the recession deepening at a rapid rate, thepossibility of an eventual loss has increased. Whatever the result, I will keep you posted.• In 2008 we began to write “credit default swaps” on individual companies. This is simply creditinsurance, similar to what we write in BHAC, except that here we bear the credit risk ofcorporations rather than of tax-exempt issuers.If, say, the XYZ company goes bankrupt, and we have written a $100 million contract, we areobligated to pay an amount that reflects the shrinkage in value of a comparable amount of XYZ’sdebt. (If, for example, the company’s bonds are selling for 30 after default, we would owe $70million.) For the typical contract, we receive quarterly payments for five years, after which ourinsurance expires.At yearend we had written $4 billion of contracts covering 42 corporations, for which we receiveannual premiums of $93 million. This is the only derivatives business we write that has anycounterparty risk; the party that buys the contract from us must be good for the quarterly premiumsit will owe us over the five years. We are unlikely to expand this business to any extent becausemost buyers of this protection now insist that the seller post collateral, and we will not enter intosuch an arrangement.• At the request of our customers, we write a few tax-exempt bond insurance contracts that aresimilar to those written at BHAC, but that are structured as derivatives. The only meaningfuldifference between the two contracts is that mark-to-market accounting is required for derivativeswhereas standard accrual accounting is required at BHAC.19But this difference can produce some strange results. The bonds covered – in effect, insured – bythese derivatives are largely general obligations of states, and we feel good about them. At yearend,however, mark-to-market accounting required us to record a loss of $631 million on thesederivatives contracts. Had we instead insured the same bonds at the same price in BHAC, and usedthe accrual accounting required at insurance companies, we would have recorded a small profitfor the year. The two methods by which we insure the bonds will eventually produce the sameaccounting result. In the short term, however, the variance in reported profits can be substantial.We have told you before that our derivative contracts, subject as they are to mark-to-marketaccounting, will produce wild swings in the earnings we report. The ups and downs neither cheer nor botherCharlie and me. Indeed, the “downs” can be helpful in that they give us an opportunity to expand a position onfavorable terms. I hope this explanation of our dealings will lead you to think similarly.************The Black-Scholes formula has approached the status of holy writ in finance, and we use it whenvaluing our equity put options for financial statement purposes. Key inputs to the calculation include a contract’smaturity and strike price, as well as the analyst’s expectations for volatility, interest rates and dividends.If the formula is applied to extended time periods, however, it can produce absurd results. In fairness,Black and Scholes almost certainly understood this point well. But their devoted followers may be ignoringwhatever caveats the two men attached when they first unveiled the formula.It’s often useful in testing a theory to push it to extremes. So let’s postulate that we sell a 100- year $1billion put option on the S&P 500 at a strike price of 903 (the index’s level on 12/31/08). Using the impliedvolatility assumption for long-dated contracts that we do, and combining that with appropriate interest anddividend assumptions, we would find the “proper” Black-Scholes premium for this contract to be $2.5 million.To judge the rationality of that premium, we need to assess whether the S&P will be valued a centuryfrom now at less than today. Certainly the dollar will then be worth a small fraction of its present value (at only2% inflation it will be worth roughly 14¢). So that will be a factor pushing the stated value of the index higher.Far more important, however, is that one hundred years of retained earnings will hugely increase the value ofmost of the companies in the index. In the 20
thCentury, the Dow-Jones Industrial Average increased by about 175-fold, mainly because of this retained-earnings factor.Considering everything, I believe the probability of a decline in the index over a one-hundred-yearperiod to befarless than 1%. But let’s use that figure and also assume that the most likely decline – should oneoccur – is 50%. Under these assumptions, the mathematical expectation of loss on our contract would be $5million ($1 billion X 1% X 50%).But if we had received our theoretical premium of $2.5 million up front, we would have only had toinvest it at 0.7% compounded annually to cover this loss expectancy. Everything earned above that would havebeen profit. Would you like to borrow money for 100 years at a 0.7% rate?Let’s look at my example from a worst-case standpoint. Remember that 99% of the time we would paynothing if my assumptions are correct. But even in the worst case among the remaining 1% of possibilities – thatis, one assuming atotalloss of $1 billion – our borrowing cost would come to only 6.2%. Clearly, either myassumptions are crazy or the formula is inappropriate.

20

The ridiculous premium that Black-Scholes dictates in my extreme example is caused by the inclusionof volatility in the formula and by the fact that volatility is determined by how much stocks have moved aroundin some past period of days, months or years. This metric is simply irrelevant in estimating the probability-weighted range of values of American business 100 years from now. (Imagine, if you will, getting a quote everyday on a farm from a manic-depressive neighbor and then using the volatility calculated from these changingquotes as an important ingredient in an equation that predicts a probability-weighted range of values for the farma century from now.)Though historical volatility is a useful – but far from foolproof – concept in valuing short-term options,its utility diminishes rapidly as the duration of the option lengthens. In my opinion, the valuations that the Black-Scholes formula now place on our long-term put options overstate our liability, though the overstatement willdiminish as the contracts approach maturity.Even so, we will continue to use Black-Scholes when we are estimating our financial-statementliability for long-term equity puts. The formula represents conventional wisdom and any substitute that I mightoffer would engender extreme skepticism. That would be perfectly understandable: CEOs who have concoctedtheir own valuations for esoteric financial instruments have seldom erred on the side of conservatism. That clubof optimists is one that Charlie and I have no desire to join.The Annual MeetingOur meeting this year will be held on Saturday, May 2
nd. As always, the doors will open at the Qwest Center at 7 a.m., and a new Berkshire movie will be shown at 8:30. At 9:30 we will go directly to thequestion-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest’s stands) will last until 3:00. Then, aftera short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:15. If you decide to leave during the day’squestion periods, please do so whileCharlieis talking.The best reason to exit, of course, is toshop. We will help you do that by filling the 194,300-square- foot hall that adjoins the meeting area with the products of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, the 31,000 peoplewho came to the meeting did their part, and almost every location racked up record sales. But you can do better.(A friendly warning: If I find sales are lagging, I lock the exits.)This year Clayton will showcase its newi-housethat includes Shaw flooring, Johns Manville insulation and MiTek fasteners. This innovative “green” home, featuring solar panels and numerous other energy-savingproducts, is truly a home of the future. Estimated costs for electricity and heating total only about $1 per daywhen the home is sited in an area like Omaha. After purchasing the i-house, you should next consider the Forest River RV and pontoon boat on display nearby. Make your neighbors jealous.GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all ofthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you ashareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 50 jurisdictions in which weoperate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that givencertain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money. Forat least 50% of you, I believe we can.On Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will have the usual array of NetJets aircraft available for yourinspection. Stop by the NetJets booth at the Qwest to learn about viewing these planes. Come to Omaha by bus;leave in your new plane. And take along – with no fear of a strip search – the Ginsu knives that you’ve purchasedat the exhibit of our Quikut subsidiary.Next, if you have any money left, visit the Bookworm, which will be selling about 30 books andDVDs. A shipping service will be available for those whose thirst for knowledge exceeds their carrying capacity.

Finally, we will have three fascinating cars on the exhibition floor, including one from the past and oneof the future. Paul Andrews, CEO of our subsidiary, TTI, will bring his 1935 Duesenberg, a car that oncebelonged to Mrs. Forrest Mars, Sr., parent and grandparent of our new partners in the Wrigley purchase. Thefuture will be represented by a new plug-in electric car developed by BYD, an amazing Chinese company inwhich we have a 10% interest.An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain thecredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. As for plane, hotel and car reservations,we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. Carol Pedersen, whohandles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it. Hotel rooms can be hard to find,but work with Carol and you will get one.At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72
ndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. We initiated this special event at NFM twelve yearsago, and sales during the “Weekend” grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to a record $33.3 million in 2008. OnSaturday of that weekend, we also set a single day record of $7.2 million. Ask any retailer what he thinks of suchvolume.To obtain the Berkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Thursday, April 30th andMonday, May 4
thinclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will evenapply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discountingbut which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate theircooperation. NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday.On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a western cookout to which you are all invited.At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail receptionfrom 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, May 1
st. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 3rd, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m.We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 27
ththrough Saturday, May 9th. During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement thatshows you are a Berkshire holder.On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion,will take on all comers – who will have their eyes wide open – in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, aremarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and SharonOsberg, two of the world’s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sundayafternoon.Gorat’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 3
rd, and will be serving from 1 p.m. until 10 p.m. Last year Gorat’s, which seats 240, served 975 dinners on Shareholder Sunday.The three-day total was 2,448 including 702 T-bone steaks, the entrée preferred by the cognoscenti. Please don’t embarrass me by ordering foie gras. Remember: To come to Gorat’s on that day, you must have a reservation. Tomake one, call 402-551-3733 on April 1
st(but not before).We will again have a reception at 4 p.m. on Saturday afternoon for shareholders who have come fromoutside North America. Every year our meeting draws many people from around the globe, and Charlie and Iwant to be sure we personally greet those who have come so far. Last year we enjoyed meeting more than 700 ofyou from many dozens of countries. Any shareholder who comes from outside the U.S. or Canada will be given aspecial credential and instructions for attending this function.************

This year we will be making important changes in how we handle the meeting’s question periods. Inrecent years, we have received only a handful of questions directly related to Berkshire and its operations. Lastyear there were practically none. So we need to steer the discussion back to Berkshire’s businesses.In a related problem, there has been a mad rush when the doors open at 7 a.m., led by people who wishto be first in line at the 12 microphones available for questioners. This is not desirable from a safety standpoint,nor do we believe that sprinting ability should be the determinant of who gets to pose questions. (At age 78, I’veconcluded that speed afoot is a ridiculously overrated talent.) Again, a new procedure is desirable.In our first change, several financial journalists from organizations representing newspapers,magazines and television will participate in the question-and-answer period, asking Charlie and me questions thatshareholders have submitted by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune,who may be emailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com,and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com. From the questions submitted,each journalist will choose the dozen or so he or she decides are the most interesting and important. (In youre-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if your question is selected.)Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know thejournalists will pick some tough ones and that’s the way we like it.In our second change, we will have a drawing at 8:15 at each microphone for those shareholdershoping to ask questions themselves. At the meeting, I will alternate the questions asked by the journalists withthose from the winning shareholders. At least half the questions – those selected by the panel from yoursubmissions – are therefore certain to be Berkshire-related. We will meanwhile continue to get some good – andperhaps entertaining – questions from the audience as well.So join us at our Woodstock for Capitalists and let us know how you like the new format. Charlie and Ilook forward to seeing you.February 27, 2009 Warren E. Buffett Chairman of the Board

In this table, Berkshire’s resultsthrough 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculated usingthe numbers originally reported.The S&P 500 numbers arepre-taxwhereas the Berkshire numbers areafter-tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the indexshowed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.
2BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:Our gain in net worth during 2009 was $21.8 billion, which increased the per-share book value of bothour Class A and Class B stock by 19.8%. Over the last 45 years (that is, since present management took over)book value has grown from $19 to $84,487, a rate of 20.3% compounded annually.*Berkshire’s recent acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) has added at least 65,000shareholders to the 500,000 or so already on our books. It’s important to Charlie Munger, my long-time partner,and me thatallof our owners understand Berkshire’s operations, goals, limitations and culture. In each annualreport, consequently, we restate the economic principles that guide us. This year these principles appear on pages89-94 and I urge all of you – but particularly our new shareholders – to read them. Berkshire has adhered to theseprinciples for decades and will continue to do so long after I’m gone.In this letter we will also review some of the basics of our business, hoping to provide both a freshmanorientation session for our BNSF newcomers and a refresher course for Berkshire veterans.How We Measure OurselvesOur metrics for evaluating our managerial performance are displayed on the facing page. From the start,Charlie and I have believed in having a rational and unbending standard for measuring what we have – or havenot – accomplished. That keeps us from the temptation of seeing where the arrow of performance lands and then painting the bull’s eye around it.Selecting the S&P 500 as our bogey was an easy choice because our shareholders, at virtually no cost, canmatch its performance by holding an index fund. Why should they pay us for merely duplicating that result?A more difficult decision for us was how to measure the progress of Berkshire versus the S&P. There aregood arguments for simply using the change in our stock price. Over an extended period of time, in fact, that isthe best test. But year-to-year market prices can be extraordinarily erratic. Even evaluations covering as long as adecade can be greatly distorted by foolishly high or low prices at the beginning or end of the measurementperiod. Steve Ballmer, of Microsoft, and Jeff Immelt, of GE, can tell you about that problem, suffering as they dofrom the nosebleed prices at which their stocks traded when they were handed the managerial baton.The ideal standard for measuring our yearly progress would be the change in Berkshire’s per-share intrinsicvalue. Alas, that value cannot be calculated with anything close to precision, so we instead use a crude proxy forit: per-share book value. Relying on this yardstick has its shortcomings, which we discuss on pages 92 and 93.Additionally, book value at most companies understates intrinsic value, and that is certainly the case atBerkshire. In aggregate, our businesses are worth considerably more than the values at which they are carried onour books. In our all-important insurance business, moreover, the difference is huge. Even so, Charlie and Ibelieve that our book value – understated though it is – supplies the most useful tracking device for changes inintrinsic value. By this measurement, as the opening paragraph of this letter states, our book value since the startof fiscal 1965 has grown at a rate of 20.3% compounded annually.
*All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are1/1500
thof those shown for A.
3We should note that had we instead chosenmarket pricesas our yardstick, Berkshire’s results would look better, showing a gain since the start of fiscal 1965 of 22% compounded annually. Surprisingly, this modestdifference in annual compounding rate leads to an 801,516% market-value gain for the entire 45-year periodcompared to the book-value gain of 434,057% (shown on page 2). Our market gain is better because in 1965Berkshire shares sold at an appropriate discount to the book value of its underearning textile assets, whereastoday Berkshire shares regularly sell at a premium to the accounting values of its first-class businesses.Summed up, the table on page 2 conveys three messages, two positive and one hugely negative. First,we have never hadanyfive-year period beginning with 1965-69 and ending with 2005-09 – and there have been41 of these – during which our gain in book value did not exceed the S&P’s gain. Second, though we have laggedthe S&P in some years that were positive for the market, we have consistently done better than the S&P in theeleven years during which it delivered negative results. In other words, our defense has been better than ouroffense, and that’s likely to continue.The big minus is that our performance advantage has shrunk dramatically as our size has grown, anunpleasant trend that iscertainto continue. To be sure, Berkshire has many outstanding businesses and a cadre oftruly great managers, operating within an unusual corporate culture that lets them maximize their talents. Charlieand I believe these factors will continue to produce better-than-average results over time. But huge sums forgetheir own anchor and our future advantage, if any, will be a small fraction of our historical edge.What We Don’t DoLong ago, Charlie laid out his strongest ambition: “All I want to know is where I’m going to die, so I’llnever go there.” That bit of wisdom was inspired by Jacobi, the great Prussian mathematician, who counseled“Invert, always invert” as an aid to solving difficult problems. (I can report as well that this inversion approachworks on a less lofty level: Sing a country song in reverse, and you will quickly recover your car, house andwife.)Here are a few examples of how we apply Charlie’s thinking at Berkshire:• Charlie and I avoid businesses whose futures we can’t evaluate, no matter how exciting theirproducts may be. In the past, it required no brilliance for people to foresee the fabulous growththat awaited such industries as autos (in 1910), aircraft (in 1930) and television sets (in 1950). Butthe future then also included competitive dynamics that would decimate almost all of thecompanies entering those industries. Even the survivors tended to come away bleeding.Just because Charlie and I can clearly see dramatic growth ahead for an industry does not meanwe can judge what its profit margins and returns on capital will be as a host of competitors battlefor supremacy. At Berkshire we will stick with businesses whose profit picture for decades tocome seems reasonably predictable. Even then, we will make plenty of mistakes.• We will never become dependent on the kindness of strangers. Too-big-to-fail is not a fallbackposition at Berkshire. Instead, we will always arrange our affairs so that any requirements for cashwe may conceivably have will be dwarfed by our own liquidity. Moreover, that liquidity will beconstantly refreshed by a gusher of earnings from our many and diverse businesses.When the financial system went into cardiac arrest in September 2008, Berkshire was a supplier of liquidity and capital to the system, not a supplicant. At the very peak of the crisis, we poured$15.5 billion into a business world that could otherwise look only to the federal government forhelp. Of that, $9 billion went to bolster capital at three highly-regarded and previously-secureAmerican businesses that needed –without delay– our tangible vote of confidence. The remaining $6.5 billion satisfied our commitment to help fund the purchase of Wrigley, a deal that wascompleted without pause while, elsewhere, panic reigned.4We pay a steep price to maintain our premier financial strength. The $20 billion-plus of cash-equivalent assets that we customarily hold is earning a pittance at present. But we sleep well.• We tend to let our many subsidiaries operate on their own, without our supervising andmonitoring them to any degree. That means we are sometimes late in spotting managementproblems and that both operating and capital decisions are occasionally made with which Charlieand I would have disagreed had we been consulted. Most of our managers, however, use theindependence we grant them magnificently, rewarding our confidence by maintaining an owner-oriented attitude that is invaluable and too seldom found in huge organizations. We would rathersuffer the visible costs of a few bad decisions than incur the many invisible costs that come fromdecisions made too slowly – or not at all – because of a stifling bureaucracy.With our acquisition of BNSF, we now have about 257,000 employees and literally hundreds ofdifferent operating units. We hope to have many more of each. But we will never allow Berkshireto become some monolith that is overrun with committees, budget presentations and multiplelayers of management. Instead, we plan to operate as a collection of separately-managed medium-sized and large businesses, most of whose decision-making occurs at the operating level. Charlieand I will limit ourselves to allocating capital, controlling enterprise risk, choosing managers andsetting their compensation.• We make no attempt to woo Wall Street. Investors who buy and sell based upon media or analystcommentary are not for us. Instead we wantpartnerswho join us at Berkshire because they wish to make a long-term investment in abusinessthey themselves understand and because it’s one thatfollows policies with which they concur. If Charlie and I were to go into a small venture with afew partners, we would seek individuals in sync with us, knowing that common goals and a shareddestiny make for a happy business “marriage” between owners and managers. Scaling up to giantsize doesn’t change that truth.To build a compatible shareholder population, we try to communicate with our owners directlyand informatively. Our goal is to tell you what we would like to know if our positions werereversed. Additionally, we try to post our quarterly and annual financial information on theInternet early on weekends, thereby giving you and other investors plenty of time during anon-trading period to digest just what has happened at our multi-faceted enterprise. (Occasionally,SEC deadlines force a non-Friday disclosure.) These matters simply can’t be adequatelysummarized in a few paragraphs, nor do they lend themselves to the kind of catchy headline thatjournalists sometimes seek.Last year we saw, in one instance, how sound-bite reporting can go wrong. Among the 12,830words in the annual letter was this sentence: “We are certain, for example, that the economy willbe in shambles throughout 2009 – and probably well beyond – but that conclusion does not tell uswhether the market will rise or fall.” Many news organizations reported – indeed, blared – the firstpart of the sentence while making no mention whatsoever of its ending. I regard this as terriblejournalism: Misinformed readers or viewers may well have thought that Charlie and I wereforecasting bad things for the stock market, though we had not only in that sentence, but alsoelsewhere, made it clear we weren’t predicting the market at all. Any investors who were misledby the sensationalists paid a big price: The Dow closed the day of the letter at 7,063 and finishedthe year at 10,428.Given a few experiences we’ve had like that, you can understand why I prefer that ourcommunications with you remain as direct and unabridged as possible.************Let’s move to the specifics of Berkshire’s operations. We have four major operating sectors, eachdiffering from the others in balance sheet and income account characteristics. Therefore, lumping them together,as is standard in financial statements, impedes analysis. So we’ll present them as four separate businesses, whichis how Charlie and I view them.5InsuranceOur property-casualty (P/C) insurance business has been the engine behind Berkshire’s growth and willcontinue to be. It has worked wonders for us. We carry our P/C companies on our books at $15.5 billion morethan their net tangible assets, an amount lodged in our “Goodwill” account. These companies, however, areworthfarmore than their carrying value – and the following look at the economic model of the P/C industry willtell you why.Insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising fromcertain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-now, pay-later modelleaves us holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, we get toinvest this float for Berkshire’s benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of floatwe hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so doesour float.If premiums exceed the total of expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit thatadds to the investment income produced from the float. This combination allows us to enjoy the use of freemoney – and, better yet, getpaidfor holding it. Alas, the hope of this happy result attracts intense competition,so vigorous in most years as to cause the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Usually this cost is fairly low, but in somecatastrophe-ridden years the cost from underwriting losses more than eats up the income derived from use offloat.In my perhaps biased view, Berkshire has the best large insurance operation in the world. And I willabsolutely state that we have the best managers. Our float has grown from $16 million in 1967, when we enteredthe business, to $62 billion at the end of 2009. Moreover, we have now operated at an underwriting profit forseven consecutive years. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwrite profitably in most – thoughcertainly not all – future years. If we do so, our float will be cost-free, much as if someone deposited $62 billionwith us that we could invest for our own benefit without the payment of interest.Let me emphasize again that cost-free float is nota result to be expected for the P/C industry as a whole: In most years, premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, theindustry’s overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of that achieved by the S&P500. Outstanding economics exist at Berkshire only because we have some outstanding managers running someunusual businesses. Our insurance CEOs deserve your thanks, having added many billions of dollars toBerkshire’s value. It’s a pleasure for me to tell you about these all-stars.************Let’s start at GEICO, which is known to all of you because of its $800 million annual advertisingbudget (close to twice that of the runner-up advertiser in the auto insurance field). GEICO is managed by TonyNicely, who joined the company at 18. Now 66, Tony still tap-dances to the office every day, just as I do at 79.We both feel lucky to work at a business we love.GEICO’s customers have warm feelings toward the company as well. Here’s proof: Since Berkshireacquired control of GEICO in 1996, its market share has increased from 2.5% to 8.1%, a gain reflecting the netaddition of seven million policyholders. Perhaps they contacted us because they thought our gecko was cute, butthey bought from us to save important money. (Maybe you can as well; call 1-800-847-7536 or go towww.GEICO.com.) And they’ve stayed with us because they like our service as well as our price.Berkshire acquired GEICO in two stages. In 1976-80 we bought about one-third of the company’sstock for $47 million. Over the years, large repurchases by the company of its own shares caused our position togrow to about 50% without our having bought any more shares. Then, on January 2, 1996, we acquired theremaining 50% of GEICO for $2.3billionin cash, about 50 times the cost of our original purchase.6An old Wall Street joke gets close to our experience:Customer: Thanks for putting me in XYZ stock at 5. I hear it’s up to 18.Broker: Yes, and that’s just the beginning. In fact, the company is doing so well now,that it’s an even better buy at 18 than it was when you made your purchase.Customer: Damn, I knew I should have waited.GEICO’s growth may slow in 2010. U.S. vehicle registrations are actually down because of slumpingauto sales. Moreover, high unemployment is causing a growing number of drivers to go uninsured. (That’s illegalalmost everywhere, but if you’ve lost your job and still want to drive . . .) Our “low-cost producer” status,however, is sure to give us significant gains in the future. In 1995, GEICO was the country’s sixth largest autoinsurer; now we are number three. The company’s float has grown from $2.7 billion to $9.6 billion. Equallyimportant, GEICO has operated at an underwriting profit in 13 of the 14 years Berkshire has owned it.I became excited about GEICO in January 1951, when I first visited the company as a 20-year-oldstudent. Thanks to Tony, I’m even more excited today.************A hugely important event in Berkshire’s history occurred on a Saturday in 1985. Ajit Jain came intoour office in Omaha – and I immediately knew we had found a superstar. (He had been discovered by MikeGoldberg, now elevated to St. Mike.)We immediately put Ajit in charge of National Indemnity’s small and struggling reinsurance operation.Over the years, he has built this business into a one-of-a-kind giant in the insurance world.Staffed today by only 30 people, Ajit’s operation has set records for transaction size in several areas ofinsurance. Ajit writes billion-dollar limits – and then keeps every dime of the risk instead of laying it off withother insurers. Three years ago, he took over huge liabilities from Lloyds, allowing it to clean up its relationshipwith 27,972 participants (“names”) who had written problem-ridden policies that at one point threatened thesurvival of this 322-year-old institution. The premium for that single contract was $7.1 billion. During 2009, henegotiated a life reinsurance contract that could produce $50 billion of premium for us over the next 50 or soyears.Ajit’s business is just the opposite of GEICO’s. At that company, we have millions of small policiesthat largely renew year after year. Ajit writes relatively few policies, and the mix changes significantly from yearto year. Throughout the world, he is known as the man to call when something both very large and unusual needsto be insured.If Charlie, I and Ajit are ever in a sinking boat – and you can only save one of us – swim to Ajit.************Our third insurance powerhouse is General Re. Some years back this operation was troubled; now it isa gleaming jewel in our insurance crown.Under the leadership of Tad Montross, General Re had an outstanding underwriting year in 2009, whilealso delivering us unusually large amounts of float per dollar of premium volume. Alongside General Re’s P/Cbusiness, Tad and his associates have developed a major life reinsurance operation that has grown increasinglyvaluable.Last year General Re finally attained 100% ownership of Cologne Re, which since 1995 has been akey – though only partially-owned – part of our presence around the world. Tad and I will be visiting Cologne inSeptember to thank its managers for their important contribution to Berkshire. 7Finally, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them specializing in odd corners of theinsurance world. In aggregate, their results have consistently been profitable and, as the table below shows, thefloat they provide us is substantial. Charlie and I treasure these companies and their managers.Here is the record of all four segments of our property-casualty and life insurance businesses:Underwriting Profit

************And now a painfulconfession: Last year your chairman closed the book on a very expensive businessfiasco entirely of his own making.For many years I had struggled to think of side products that we could offer our millions of loyalGEICO customers. Unfortunately, I finally succeeded, coming up with a brilliant insight that we should marketour own credit card. I reasoned that GEICO policyholders were likely to be good credit risks and, assuming weoffered an attractive card, would likely favor us with their business. We got business all right – but of the wrongtype.Our pre-tax losses from credit-card operations came to about $6.3 million before I finally woke up. Wethen sold our $98 million portfolio of troubled receivables for 55¢ on the dollar, losing an additional $44 million.GEICO’s managers, it should be emphasized, were never enthusiastic about my idea. They warned methat instead of getting the cream of GEICO’s customers we would get the –––––well, let’s call it the non-cream. I subtly indicated that I was older and wiser.I was just older.Regulated Utility BusinessBerkshire has an 89.5% interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which owns a wide variety ofutility operations. The largest of these are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, whose 3.8 million endusers make it the U.K.’s third largest distributor of electricity; (2) MidAmerican Energy, which serves 725,000electric customers, primarily in Iowa; (3) Pacific Power and Rocky Mountain Power, serving about 1.7 millionelectric customers in six western states; and (4) Kern River and Northern Natural pipelines, which carry about8% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S.MidAmerican has two terrific managers, Dave Sokol and Greg Abel. In addition, my long-time friend,Walter Scott, along with his family, has a major ownership position in the company. Walter brings extraordinarybusiness savvy toanyoperation. Ten years of working with Dave, Greg and Walter have reinforced my originalbelief: Berkshire couldn’t have better partners. They are truly a dream team.Somewhat incongruously, MidAmerican also owns the second largest real estate brokerage firm in theU.S., HomeServices of America. This company operates through 21 locally-branded firms that have 16,000agents. Though last year was again a terrible year for home sales, HomeServices earned a modest sum. It alsoacquired a firm in Chicago and will add other quality brokerage operations when they are available at sensibleprices. A decade from now, HomeServices is likely to be much larger. 8Here are some key figures on MidAmerican’s operations: Earnings (in millions)

Permitting and construction periods for generation and major transmission facilitiesstretch way out, so it is incumbent on us to be far-sighted. We, in turn, look to our utilities’ regulators (acting onbehalf of our customers) to allow us an appropriate return on the huge amounts of capital we must deploy to meetfuture needs. We shouldn’t expect our regulators to live up to their end of the bargain unless we live up to ours.Dave and Greg make sure we do just that. National research companies consistently rank our Iowa andWestern utilities at or near the top of their industry. Similarly, among the 43 U.S. pipelines ranked by a firmnamed Mastio, our Kern River and Northern Natural properties tied for second place.Moreover, we continue to pour huge sums of money into our operations so as to not only prepare forthe future but also make these operations more environmentally friendly. Since we purchased MidAmerican tenyears ago, it hasneverpaid a dividend. We have instead used earnings to improve and expand our properties ineach of the territories we serve. As one dramatic example, in the last three years our Iowa and Western utilitieshave earned $2.5 billion, while in this same period spending $3 billion on wind generation facilities.MidAmerican has consistently kept its end of the bargain with society and, to society’s credit, it hasreciprocated: With few exceptions, our regulators have promptly allowed us to earn a fair return on the ever-increasing sums of capital we must invest. Going forward, we will do whatever it takes to serve our territories inthe manner they expect. We believe that, in turn, we will be allowed the return we deserve on the funds weinvest.In earlier days, Charlie and I shunned capital-intensive businesses such as public utilities. Indeed, thebest businesses by far for owners continue to be those that have high returns on capital and that require littleincremental investment to grow. We are fortunate to own a number of such businesses, and we would love to buymore. Anticipating, however, that Berkshire will generate ever-increasing amounts of cash, we are today quitewilling to enter businesses that regularly require large capital expenditures. We expect only that these businesseshave reasonable expectations of earning decent returns on the incremental sums they invest. If our expectationsare met – and we believe that they will be – Berkshire’s ever-growing collection of good to great businessesshould produce above-average, though certainly not spectacular, returns in the decades ahead.9Our BNSF operation, it should be noted, has certain important economic characteristics that resemblethose of our electric utilities. In both cases we provide fundamental services that are, and will remain, essential tothe economic well-being of our customers, the communities we serve, and indeed the nation. Both will requireheavy investment that greatly exceeds depreciation allowances for decades to come. Both must also plan farahead to satisfy demand that is expected to outstrip the needs of the past. Finally, both require wise regulatorswho will provide certainty about allowable returns so that we can confidently make the huge investmentsrequired to maintain, replace and expand the plant.We see a “social compact” existing between the public and our railroad business, just as is the casewith our utilities. If either side shirks its obligations, both sides will inevitably suffer. Therefore, both parties tothe compact should – and we believe will – understand the benefit of behaving in a way that encourages goodbehavior by the other. It is inconceivable that our country will realize anything close to its full economicpotential without its possessing first-class electricity and railroad systems. We will do our part to see that theyexist.In the future, BNSF results will be included in this “regulated utility” section. Aside from the twobusinesses having similar underlying economic characteristics, both are logical users of substantial amounts ofdebt that isnotguaranteed by Berkshire. Both will retain most of their earnings. Both will earn and invest largesums in good times or bad, though the railroad will display the greater cyclicality. Overall, we expect thisregulated sector to deliver significantly increased earnings over time, albeit at the cost of our investing many tens– yes, tens – of billions of dollars of incremental equity capital.Manufacturing, Service and Retailing OperationsOur activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront. Let’s look, though, at a summary balancesheet and earnings statement for the entire group.

The major exception was McLane, our distributor of groceries, confections andnon-food items to thousands of retail outlets, the largest by far Wal-Mart.Grady Rosier led McLane to record pre-tax earnings of $344 million, which even so amounted to onlyslightly more than one cent per dollar on its huge sales of $31.2 billion. McLane employs a vast array of physicalassets – practically all of which it owns – including 3,242 trailers, 2,309 tractors and 55 distribution centers with15.2 million square feet of space. McLane’s prime asset, however, is Grady.We had a number of companies at which profits improved even as sales contracted, always anexceptional managerial achievement. Here are the CEOs who made it happen:COMPANY

Brown (manufacturing and retailing of shoes) Jim IsslerCTB (agricultural equipment) Vic MancinelliDairy Queen John GainorNebraska Furniture Mart (furniture retailing) Ron and Irv BlumkinPampered Chef (direct sales of kitchen tools) Marla GottschalkSee’s (manufacturing and retailing of candy) Brad KinstlerStar Furniture (furniture retailing) Bill KimbrellAmong the businesses we own that have major exposure to the depressed industrial sector, bothMarmon and Iscar turned in relatively strong performances. Frank Ptak’s Marmon delivered a 13.5% pre-taxprofit margin, a record high. Though the company’s sales were down 27%, Frank’s cost-conscious managementmitigated the decline in earnings.Nothing stops Israel-based Iscar – not wars, recessions or competitors. The world’s two other leadingsuppliers of small cutting tools both had very difficult years, each operating at a loss throughout much of theyear. Though Iscar’s results were down significantly from 2008, the company regularly reported profits, evenwhile it was integrating and rationalizing Tungaloy, the large Japanese acquisition that we told you about lastyear. When manufacturing rebounds, Iscar will set new records. Its incredible managerial team of EitanWertheimer, Jacob Harpaz and Danny Goldman will see to that.Every business we own that is connected to residential and commercial construction suffered severelyin 2009. Combined pre-tax earnings of Shaw, Johns Manville, Acme Brick, and MiTek were $227 million, an82.5% decline from $1.295 billion in 2006, when construction activity was booming. These businesses continueto bump along the bottom, though their competitive positions remain undented.The major problem for Berkshire last year was NetJets, an aviation operation that offers fractionalownership of jets. Over the years, it has been enormously successful in establishing itself as the premier companyin its industry, with the value of its fleet far exceeding that of its three major competitors combined. Overall, our dominance in the field remains unchallenged.NetJets’ business operation, however, has been another story. In the eleven years that we have ownedthe company, it has recorded an aggregate pre-tax loss of $157 million. Moreover, the company’s debt has soaredfrom $102 million at the time of purchase to $1.9 billion in April of last year. Without Berkshire’s guarantee ofthis debt, NetJets would have been out of business. It’s clear that I failed you in letting NetJets descend into thiscondition. But, luckily, I have been bailed out.
11Dave Sokol, the enormously talented builder and operator of MidAmerican Energy, became CEO ofNetJets in August. His leadership has been transforming: Debt has already been reduced to $1.4 billion, and, aftersuffering a staggering loss of $711 million in 2009, the company is now solidly profitable.Most important, none of the changes wrought by Dave have in any way undercut the top-of-the-linestandards for safety and service that Rich Santulli, NetJets’ previous CEO and the father of the fractional-ownership industry, insisted upon. Dave and I have the strongest possible personal interest in maintaining thesestandards because we and our families use NetJets for almost all of our flying, as do many of our directors andmanagers. None of us are assigned special planes nor crews. We receive exactly the same treatment as any otherowner, meaning we pay the same prices as everyone else does when we are using our personal contracts. In short,we eat our own cooking. In the aviation business, no other testimonial means more.Finance and Financial ProductsOur largest operation in this sector is Clayton Homes, the country’s leading producer of modular andmanufactured homes. Clayton was not always number one: A decade ago the three leading manufacturers wereFleetwood, Champion and Oakwood, which together accounted for 44% of the output of the industry. All havesince gone bankrupt. Total industry output, meanwhile, has fallen from 382,000 units in 1999 to 60,000 units in2009.The industry is in shambles for two reasons, the first of which must be lived with if the U.S. economyis to recover. This reason concerns U.S. housing starts (including apartment units). In 2009, starts were 554,000,by far the lowest number in the 50 years for which we have data. Paradoxically, this is goodnews. Peoplethoughtit was good news a few years back when housing starts – the supply side of the picture– were running about two million annually. But household formations – the demand side – only amounted toabout 1.2 million. After a few years of such imbalances, the country unsurprisingly ended up with far too manyhouses.There were three ways to cure this overhang: (1) blow up a lot of houses, a tactic similar to thedestruction of autos that occurred with the “cash-for-clunkers” program; (2) speed up household formations by,say, encouraging teenagers to cohabitate, a program not likely to suffer from a lack of volunteers or; (3) reducenew housing starts to a number far below the rate of household formations.Our country has wisely selected the third option, which means that within a year or so residentialhousing problems should largely be behind us, the exceptions being only high-value houses and those in certainlocalities where overbuilding was particularly egregious. Prices will remain far below “bubble” levels, of course,but for every seller (or lender) hurt by this there will be a buyer who benefits. Indeed, many families that couldn’tafford to buy an appropriate home a few years ago now find it well within their means because the bubble burst.The second reason that manufactured housing is troubled is specific to the industry: the punitivedifferential in mortgage rates between factory-built homes and site-built homes. Before you read further, let meunderscore the obvious: Berkshire has a dog in this fight, and you should therefore assess the commentary thatfollows with special care. That warning made, however, let me explain why the rate differential causes problemsfor both large numbers of lower-income Americans and Clayton.The residential mortgage market is shaped by government rules that are expressed by FHA, FreddieMac and Fannie Mae. Their lending standards are all-powerful because the mortgages they insure can typicallybe securitized and turned into what, in effect, is an obligation of the U.S. government. Currently buyers ofconventional site-built homes who qualify for these guarantees can obtain a 30-year loan at about 5
1⁄4%. In addition, these are mortgages that have recently been purchased in massive amounts by the Federal Reserve, anaction that also helped to keep rates at bargain-basement levels.In contrast, very few factory-built homes qualify for agency-insured mortgages. Therefore, ameritorious buyer of a factory-built home must pay about 9% on his loan. For the all-cash buyer, Clayton’shomes offer terrific value. If the buyer needs mortgage financing, however – and, of course, most buyers do – thedifference in financing costs too often negates the attractive price of a factory-built home. 12Last year I told you why our buyers – generally people with low incomes – performed so well as creditrisks. Their attitude was all-important: They signed up to live in the home, not resell or refinance it.Consequently, our buyers usually took out loans with payments geared to their verified incomes (we weren’tmaking “liar’s loans”) and looked forward to the day they could burn their mortgage. If they lost their jobs, hadhealth problems or got divorced, we could of course expect defaults. But they seldom walked away simplybecause house values had fallen. Even today, though job-loss troubles have grown, Clayton’s delinquencies anddefaults remain reasonable and will not cause us significant problems.We have tried to qualify more of our customers’ loans for treatment similar to those available on thesite-built product. So far we have had only token success. Many families with modest incomes but responsiblehabits have therefore had to forego home ownership simply because the financing differential attached to thefactory-built product makes monthly payments too expensive. If qualifications aren’t broadened, so as to openlow-cost financing toallwho meet down-payment and income standards, the manufactured-home industry seemsdestined to struggle and dwindle.Even under these conditions, I believe Clayton will operate profitably in coming years, though wellbelow its potential. We couldn’t have a better manager than CEO Kevin Clayton, who treats Berkshire’s interestsas if they were his own. Our product is first-class, inexpensive and constantly being improved. Moreover, we willcontinue to use Berkshire’s credit to support Clayton’s mortgage program, convinced as we are of its soundness.Even so, Berkshire can’t borrow at a rate approaching that available to government agencies. This handicap willlimit sales, hurting both Clayton and a multitude of worthy families who long for a low-cost home.In the following table, Clayton’s earnings are net of the company’s payment to Berkshire for the use ofits credit. Offsetting this cost to Clayton is an identical amount of income credited to Berkshire’s financeoperation and included in “Other Income.” The cost and income amount was $116 million in 2009 and $92million in 2008.The table also illustrates how severely our furniture (CORT) and trailer (XTRA) leasing operationshave been hit by the recession. Though their competitive positions remain as strong as ever, we have yet to seeany bounce in these businesses. Pre-Tax Earnings

In addition to servicing a $235 billionportfolio, the company is an important originator of mortgages, having 25 offices spread around the country.Though commercial real estate will face major problems in the next few years, long-term opportunities forBerkadia are significant.
13Our partner in this operation is Leucadia, run by Joe Steinberg and Ian Cumming, with whom we had aterrific experience some years back when Berkshire joined with them to purchase Finova, a troubled financebusiness. In resolving that situation, Joe and Ian did far more than their share of the work, an arrangement Ialways encourage. Naturally, I was delighted when they called me to partner again in the Capmark purchase.Our first venture was also christened Berkadia. So let’s call this one Son of Berkadia. Someday I’ll bewriting you about Grandson of Berkadia.InvestmentsBelow we show our common stock investments that at yearend had a market value of more than $1 billion. 12/31/09Shares

*This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP “cost” differs in a few cases because ofwrite-ups or write-downs that have been required.In addition, we own positions in non-traded securities of Dow Chemical, General Electric, GoldmanSachs, Swiss Re and Wrigley with an aggregate cost of $21.1 billion and a carrying value of $26.0 billion. Wepurchased these five positions in the last 18 months. Setting aside the significant equity potential they provide us,these holdings deliver us an aggregate of $2.1 billion annually in dividends and interest. Finally, we owned76,777,029 shares (22.5%) of BNSF at yearend, which we then carried at $85.78 per share, but which havesubsequently been melded into our purchase of the entire company.In 2009, our largest sales were in ConocoPhillips, Moody’s, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson(sales of the latter occurring after we had built our position earlier in the year). Charlie and I believe that all ofthese stocks will likely trade higher in the future. We made some sales early in 2009 to raise cash for our Dowand Swiss Re purchases and late in the year made other sales in anticipation of our BNSF purchase.
14We told you last year that very unusual conditions then existed in the corporate and municipal bondmarkets and that these securities were ridiculously cheap relative to U.S. Treasuries. We backed this view withsome purchases, but I should have done far more. Big opportunities come infrequently. When it’s raining gold,reach for a bucket, not a thimble.We entered 2008 with $44.3 billion of cash-equivalents, and we have since retained operating earningsof $17 billion. Nevertheless, at yearend 2009, our cash was down to $30.6 billion (with $8 billion earmarked forthe BNSF acquisition). We’ve put a lot of money to work during the chaos of the last two years. It’s been anideal period for investors: A climate of fear is their best friend. Those who invest only when commentators areupbeat end up paying a heavy price for meaningless reassurance. In the end, what counts in investing is what youpay for a business – through the purchase of a small piece of it in the stock market – and what that business earnsin the succeeding decade or two.************Last year I wrote extensively about our derivatives contracts, which were then the subject of bothcontroversy and misunderstanding. For that discussion, please go to www.berkshirehathaway.com.We have since changed only a few of our positions. Some credit contracts have run off. The terms ofabout 10% of our equity put contracts have also changed: Maturities have been shortened and strike pricesmaterially reduced. In these modifications, no money changed hands.A few points from last year’s discussion are worth repeating:(1) Though it’s no sure thing, I expect our contracts in aggregate to deliver us a profit over their lifetime,even when investment income on the huge amount of float they provide us is excluded in thecalculation. Our derivatives float – which is not included in the $62 billion of insurance float Idescribed earlier – was about $6.3 billion at yearend.(2) Only a handful of our contracts require us to post collateral under any circumstances. At last year’s lowpoint in the stock and credit markets, our posting requirement was $1.7 billion, a small fraction of thederivatives-related float we held. When we do post collateral, let me add, the securities we put upcontinue to earn money for our account.(3) Finally, you should expect large swings in the carrying value of these contracts, items that can affectour reported quarterly earnings in a huge way but that do not affect our cash or investment holdings.That thought certainly fit 2009’s circumstances. Here are the pre-tax quarterly gains and losses fromderivatives valuations that were part of our reported earnings last year:Quarter
$ Gain (Loss) in Billions
1 (1.517)2 2.3573 1.7324 1.052As we’ve explained, these wild swings neither cheer nor bother Charlie and me. When we report toyou, we will continue to separate out these figures (as we do realized investment gains and losses) so that you canmore clearly view the earnings of our operating businesses. We are delighted that we hold the derivativescontracts that we do. To date we have significantly profited from the float they provide. We expect also to earnfurther investment income over the life of our contracts.
15We have long invested in derivatives contracts that Charlie and I think are mispriced, just as we try toinvest in mispriced stocks and bonds. Indeed, we first reported to you that we held such contracts in early 1998.The dangers that derivatives pose for both participants and society – dangers of which we’ve long warned, andthat can be dynamite – arise when these contracts lead to leverage and/or counterparty risk that is extreme. AtBerkshire nothing like that has occurred – nor will it.It’s my job to keep Berkshire far away from such problems. Charlie and I believe that a CEO must notdelegate risk control. It’s simply too important. At Berkshire, I both initiate and monitor everyderivatives contract on our books, with the exception of operations-related contracts at a few of our subsidiaries, such asMidAmerican, and the minor runoff contracts at General Re. If Berkshire ever gets in trouble, it will be myfault. It will not be because of misjudgments made by a Risk Committee or Chief Risk Officer.************In my view a board of directors of a huge financial institution is derelictif it does not insist that its CEO bear full responsibility for risk control. If he’s incapable of handling that job, he should look for otheremployment. And if he fails at it – with the government thereupon required to step in with funds or guarantees –the financial consequences for him and his board should be severe.It has not been shareholders who have botched the operations of some of our country’s largest financialinstitutions. Yet they have borne the burden, with 90% or more of the value of their holdings wiped out in mostcases of failure. Collectively, they have lost more than $500 billion in just the four largest financial fiascos of thelast two years. To say theseownershave been “bailed-out” is to make a mockery of the term.The CEOs and directors of the failed companies, however, have largely gone unscathed. Their fortunes mayhave been diminished by the disasters they oversaw, but they still live in grand style. It is the behavior of theseCEOs and directors that needs to be changed: If their institutions and the country are harmed by theirrecklessness, they should pay a heavy price – one not reimbursable by the companies they’ve damaged nor byinsurance. CEOs and, in many cases, directors have long benefitted from oversized financial carrots; somemeaningfulsticks now need to be part of their employment picture as well.An Inconvenient Truth (Boardroom Overheating)Our subsidiaries made a few small “bolt-on” acquisitions last year for cash, but our blockbuster dealwith BNSF required us to issue about 95,000 Berkshire shares that amounted to 6.1% of those previouslyoutstanding. Charlie and I enjoy issuing Berkshire stock about as much as we relish prepping for a colonoscopy.The reason for our distaste is simple. If we wouldn’t dream of selling Berkshire in its entirety at thecurrent market price, why in the world should we “sell” a significant part of the company at that same inadequateprice by issuing our stock in a merger?In evaluating a stock-for-stock offer, shareholders of the target company quite understandably focus onthe market price of the acquirer’s shares that are to be given them. But they also expect the transaction to deliverthem theintrinsicvalue of their own shares – the ones they are giving up. If shares of a prospective acquirer areselling below their intrinsic value, it’s impossible for that buyer to make a sensible deal in an all-stock deal. Yousimply can’t exchange an undervalued stock for a fully-valued one without hurting your shareholders.Imagine, if you will, Company A and Company B, of equal size and both with businesses intrinsicallyworth $100 per share. Both of their stocks, however, sell for $80 per share. The CEO of A, long on confidenceand short on smarts, offers 1
1⁄4shares of A for each share of B, correctly telling his directors that B is worth $100per share. He will neglect to explain, though, that what he is giving will cost his shareholders $125 in intrinsicvalue. If the directors are mathematically challenged as well, and a deal is therefore completed, the shareholdersof B will end up owning 55.6% of A & B’s combined assets and A’s shareholders will own 44.4%. Not everyoneat A, it should be noted, is a loser from this nonsensical transaction. Its CEO now runs a company twice as largeas his original domain, in a world where size tends to correlate with both prestige and compensation.16If an acquirer’s stock is overvalued, it’s a different story: Using it as a currency works to the acquirer’sadvantage. That’s why bubbles in various areas of the stock market have invariably led to serial issuances ofstock by sly promoters. Going by the market value of their stock, they can afford to overpay because they are, ineffect, using counterfeit money. Periodically, many air-for-assets acquisitions have taken place, the late 1960shaving been a particularly obscene period for such chicanery. Indeed, certain large companies were built in thisway. (No one involved, of course, ever publicly acknowledges the reality of what is going on, though there isplenty of private snickering.)In our BNSF acquisition, the selling shareholders quite properly evaluated our offer at $100 per share.The cost to us, however, was somewhat higher since 40% of the $100 was delivered in our shares, which Charlieand I believed to be worth more than their market value. Fortunately, we had long owned a substantial amount ofBNSF stock that we purchased in the market for cash. All told, therefore, only about 30% of our cost overall waspaid with Berkshire shares.In the end, Charlie and I decided that the disadvantage of paying 30% of the price through stock wasoffset by the opportunity the acquisition gave us to deploy $22 billion of cash in a business we understood andliked for the long term. It has the additional virtue of being run by Matt Rose, whom we trust and admire. Wealso like the prospect of investing additional billions over the years at reasonable rates of return. But the finaldecision was a close one. If we had needed to use more stock to make the acquisition, it would in fact have madeno sense. We would have then been giving up more than we were getting.************I have been in dozens of board meetings in which acquisitions have been deliberated, often with thedirectors being instructed by high-priced investment bankers (are there any other kind?). Invariably, the bankersgive the board a detailed assessment of the value of the company being purchased, with emphasis on why it isworth far more than its market price. In more than fifty years of board memberships, however, never have I heardthe investment bankers (or management!) discuss the true value of what is being given. When a deal involved the issuance of the acquirer’s stock, they simply used market value to measure the cost. They did this even though they would have argued that the acquirer’s stock price was woefully inadequate – absolutely no indicator of itsreal value – had a takeover bid for the acquirer instead been the subject up for discussion . When stock is the currency being contemplated in an acquisition and when directors are hearing froman advisor, it appears to me that there is only one way to get a rational and balanced discussion. Directors shouldhire a second advisor to make the caseagainstthe proposed acquisition, with its fee contingent on the deal not going through. Absent this drastic remedy, our recommendation in respect to the use of advisors remains: “Don’task the barber whether you need a haircut.”************I can’t resist telling you a true story from long ago. We owned stock in a large well-run bank that fordecades had been statutorily prevented from acquisitions. Eventually, the law was changed and our bankimmediately began looking for possible purchases. Its managers – fine people and able bankers – notunexpectedly began to behave like teenage boys who had just discovered girls.They soon focused on a much smaller bank, also well-run and having similar financial characteristicsin such areas as return on equity, interest margin, loan quality, etc. Our bank sold at a modest price (that’s whywe had bought into it), hovering near book value and possessing a very low price/earnings ratio. Alongside,though, the small-bank owner was being wooed by other large banks in the state and was holding out for a priceclose to three times book value. Moreover, he wanted stock, not cash.Naturally, our fellows caved in and agreed to this value-destroying deal. “We need to show that we arein the hunt. Besides, it’s only a small deal,” they said, as if only majorharm to shareholders would have been a legitimate reason for holding back. Charlie’s reaction at the time: “Are we supposed to applaud because the dogthat fouls our lawn is a Chihuahua rather than a Saint Bernard?”17The seller of the smaller bank – no fool – then delivered one final demand in his negotiations. “Afterthe merger,” he in effect said, perhaps using words that were phrased more diplomatically than these, “I’m goingto be a large shareholder of your bank, and it will represent a huge portion of my net worth. You have to promiseme, therefore, that you’ll never again do a deal this dumb.”Yes, the merger went through. The owner of the small bank became richer, we became poorer, and themanagers of the big bank – newly bigger – lived happily ever after.The Annual MeetingOur best guess is that 35,000 people attended the annual meeting last year (up from 12 – nozeros omitted – in 1981). With our shareholder population much expanded, we expect even more this year. Therefore,we will have to make a few changes in the usual routine. There will be no change, however, in our enthusiasmfor having you attend. Charlie and I like to meet you, answer your questions and – best of all – have you buylots of goods from our businesses.The meeting this year will be held on Saturday, May 1
st. As always, the doors will open at the Qwest Center at 7 a.m., and a new Berkshire movie will be shown at 8:30. At 9:30 we will go directly to thequestion-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest’s stands) will last until 3:30. After ashort recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decide to leave during the day’squestion periods, please do so whileCharlieis talking. (Act fast; he can be terse.)The best reason to exit, of course, is toshop. We will help you do that by filling the 194,300-square- foot hall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you didyour part, and most locations racked up record sales. But you can do better. (A friendly warning: If I find salesare lagging, I get testy and lock the exits.)GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all ofthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you ashareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which weoperate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that givencertain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money. Forat least 50% of you, I believe we can.Be sure to visit the Bookworm. Among the more than 30 books and DVDs it will offer are two newbooks by my sons: Howard’sFragile, a volume filled with photos and commentary about lives of strugglearound the globe and Peter’sLife Is What You Make It. Completing the family trilogy will be the debut of my sister Doris’s biography, a story focusing on her remarkable philanthropic activities. Also available will be Poor Charlie’s Almanack, the story of my partner. This book is something of a publishing miracle – never advertised,yet year after year selling many thousands of copies from its Internet site. (Should you need to ship your bookpurchases, a nearby shipping service will be available.)If you are a big spender – or, for that matter, merely a gawker – visit Elliott Aviation on the east side ofthe Omaha airport between noon and 5:00 p.m. on Saturday. There we will have a fleet of NetJets aircraft thatwill get your pulse racing.An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain thecredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. As for plane, hotel and car reservations,we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. Carol Pedersen, whohandles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it. Hotel rooms can be hard to find,but work with Carol and you will get one.
18At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72ndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. To obtain the Berkshire discount, you must makeyour purchases between Thursday, April 29
thand Monday, May 3rdinclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers thatnormally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have madean exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday throughSaturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having aBerkyville BBQ to which you are all invited.At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail receptionfrom 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, April 30
th. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 2nd, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m.We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 26
ththrough Saturday, May 8th. During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement thatshows you are a Berkshire holder. Enter with rhinestones; leave with diamonds. My daughter tells me that themore you buy, the more you save (kids say the darnedest things).On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion,will take on all comers – who will have their eyes wide open – in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, aremarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers.Our special treat for shareholders this year will be the return of my friend, Ariel Hsing, the country’stop-ranked junior table tennis player (and a good bet to win at the Olympics some day). Now 14, Ariel came tothe annual meeting four years ago and demolished all comers, including me. (You can witness my humiliatingdefeat on YouTube; just type in Ariel Hsing Berkshire.)Naturally, I’ve been plotting a comeback and will take her on outside of Borsheims at 1:00 p.m. onSunday. It will be a three-point match, and after I soften her up, all shareholders are invited to try their luck atsimilar three-point contests. Winners will be given a box of See’s candy. We will have equipment available, butbring your own paddle if you think it will help. (It won’t.)Gorat’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 2
nd, and will be serving from 1 p.m. until 10 p.m. Last year, though, it was overwhelmed by demand. With many more dinersexpected this year, I’ve asked my friend, Donna Sheehan, at Piccolo’s – another favorite restaurant of mine – toserve shareholders on Sunday as well. (Piccolo’s giant root beer float is mandatory for any fan of fine dining.) Iplan to eat at both restaurants: All of the weekend action makes me reallyhungry, and I have favorite dishes at each spot. Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call 402-551-3733 on April 1
st(but not before) and at Piccolo’s call 402-342-9038.Regrettably, we will not be able to have a reception for international visitors this year. Our count grewto about 800 last year, and my simply signing one item per person took about 2
1⁄2hours. Since we expect even more international visitors this year, Charlie and I decided we must drop this function. But be assured, wewelcome every international visitor who comes.Last year we changed our method of determining what questions would be asked at the meeting andreceived many dozens of letters applauding the new arrangement. We will therefore again have the same threefinancial journalists lead the question-and-answer period, asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders havesubmitted to them by e-mail.
19The journalists and their e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be e-mailed atcloomis@fortunemail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com, and Andrew RossSorkin, of The New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com. From the questions submitted, each journalist willchoose the dozen or so he or she decides are the most interesting and important. The journalists have told meyour question has the best chance of being selected if you keep it concise and include no more than two questionsin any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned ifyour question is selected.)Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know thejournalists will pick some tough ones and that’s the way we like it.We will again have a drawing at 8:15 on Saturday at each of 13 microphones for those shareholderswishing to ask questions themselves. At the meeting, I will alternate the questions asked by the journalists withthose from the winning shareholders. We’ve added 30 minutes to the question time and will probably have timefor about 30 questions from each group.***********At 86 and 79, Charlie and I remain lucky beyond our dreams. We were born in America; had terrificparents who saw that we got good educations; have enjoyed wonderful families and great health; and cameequipped with a “business” gene that allows us to prosper in a manner hugely disproportionate to thatexperienced by many people who contribute as much or more to our society’s well-being. Moreover, we havelong had jobs that we love, in which we are helped in countless ways by talented and cheerful associates. Indeed,over the years, our work has become ever more fascinating; no wonder we tap-dance to work. If pushed, wewould gladly pay substantial sums to have our jobs (but don’t tell the Comp Committee).Nothing, however, is more fun for us than getting together with our shareholder-partners at Berkshire’sannual meeting. So join us on May 1
stat the Qwest for our annual Woodstock for Capitalists. We’ll see youthere.February 26, 2010 Warren E. Buffett Chairman of the Board P.S. Come by rail.

In this table, Berkshire’s resultsthrough 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculated usingthe numbers originally reported.The S&P 500 numbers arepre-taxwhereas the Berkshire numbers areafter-tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the indexshowed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.
2BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:The per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stock increased by 13% in 2010. Over thelast 46 years (that is, since present management took over), book value has grown from $19 to $95,453, a rate of20.2% compounded annually.*The highlight of 2010 was our acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe, a purchase that’s workingout even better than I expected. It now appears that owning this railroad will increase Berkshire’s “normal”earning power by nearly 40% pre-tax and by well over 30% after-tax. Making this purchase increased our sharecount by 6% and used $22 billion of cash. Since we’ve quickly replenished the cash, the economics of thistransaction have turned out very well.A “normal year,” of course, is not something that either Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of Berkshireand my partner, or I can define with anything like precision. But for the purpose of estimating our current earningpower, we are envisioning a year free of a mega-catastrophe in insurance and possessing a general businessclimate somewhat better than that of 2010 but weaker than that of 2005 or 2006. Using these assumptions, andseveral others that I will explain in the “Investment” section, I can estimate that the normal earning power of theassets we currently own is about $17 billion pre-tax and $12 billion after-tax, excluding any capital gains orlosses. Every day Charlie and I think about how we can build on this base.Both of us are enthusiastic about BNSF’s future because railroads have major cost and environmentaladvantages over trucking, their main competitor. Last year BNSF moved each ton of freight it carried a record500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. That’s threetimes more fuel-efficient than trucking is, which means our railroad owns an important advantage in operating costs. Concurrently, our country gains because of reducedgreenhouse emissions and a much smaller need for imported oil. When traffic travels by rail, society benefits.Over time, the movement of goods in the United States will increase, and BNSF should get its fullshare of the gain. The railroad will need to invest massively to bring about this growth, but no one is bettersituated than Berkshire to supply the funds required. However slow the economy, or chaotic the markets, ourchecks will clear.Last year – in the face of widespread pessimism about our economy – we demonstrated our enthusiasmfor capital investment at Berkshire by spending $6 billion on property and equipment. Of this amount,$5.4 billion – or 90% of the total – was spent in the United States. Certainly our businesses will expand abroad inthe future, but an overwhelming part of their future investments will be at home. In 2011, we will set a newrecord for capital spending – $8 billion – and spend allof the $2 billion increase in the United States.Money will always flow toward opportunity, and there is an abundance of that in America.Commentators today often talk of “great uncertainty.” But think back, for example, to December 6,1941, October 18, 1987 and September 10, 2001. No matter how serene today may be, tomorrow is always uncertain.
* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are1/1500
thof those shown for A.3Don’t let that reality spook you. Throughout my lifetime, politicians and pundits have constantlymoaned about terrifying problems facing America. Yet our citizens now live an astonishing six times better thanwhen I was born. The prophets of doom have overlooked the all-important factor that iscertain: Human potential is far from exhausted, and the American system for unleashing that potential – a system that has worked wondersfor over two centuries despite frequent interruptions for recessions and even a Civil War – remains alive andeffective.We are not natively smarter than we were when our country was founded nor do we work harder. Butlook around you and see a world beyond the dreams of any colonial citizen. Now, as in 1776, 1861, 1932 and1941, America’s best days lie ahead.PerformanceCharlie and I believe that those entrusted with handling the funds of others should establishperformance goals at the onset of their stewardship. Lacking such standards, managements are tempted to shootthe arrow of performance and then paint the bull’s-eye around wherever it lands.In Berkshire’s case, we long ago told you that our job is to increase per-share intrinsic value at a rategreater than the increase (including dividends) of the S&P 500. In some years we succeed; in others we fail. But,if we are unable over time to reach that goal, we have done nothing for our investors, who by themselves couldhave realized an equal or better result by owning an index fund.The challenge, of course, is the calculation of intrinsic value. Present that task to Charlie and meseparately, and you will get two different answers. Precision just isn’t possible.To eliminate subjectivity, we therefore use an understatedproxy for intrinsic-value – book value – when measuring our performance. To be sure, some of our businesses are worth far more than their carryingvalue on our books. (Later in this report, we’ll present a case study.) But since that premium seldom swingswildly from year to year, book value can serve as a reasonable device for tracking how we are doing.The table on page 2 shows our 46-year record against the S&P, a performance quite good in the earlieryears and now only satisfactory. The bountiful years, we want to emphasize, will never return. The huge sums ofcapital we currently manage eliminateanychance of exceptional performance. We will strive, however, forbetter-than-average results and feel it fair for you to hold us to that standard.Yearly figures, it should be noted, are neither to be ignored nor viewed as all-important. The pace ofthe earth’s movement around the sun is not synchronized with the time required for either investment ideas oroperating decisions to bear fruit. At GEICO, for example, we enthusiastically spent $900 million last year onadvertising to obtain policyholders who deliver us no immediate profits. If we could spend twice that amountproductively, we would happily do so though short-term results would be further penalized. Many largeinvestments at our railroad and utility operations are also made with an eye to payoffs well down the road.To provide you a longer-term perspective on performance, we present on the facing page the yearlyfigures from page 2 recast into a series of five-year periods. Overall, there are 42 of these periods, and they tellan interesting story. On a comparative basis, our best years ended in the early 1980s. The market’sgolden period, however, came in the 17 following years, with Berkshire achieving stellar absolute returns even as our relativeadvantage narrowed.After 1999, the market stalled (or have you already noticed that?). Consequently, the satisfactoryperformance relative to the S&P that Berkshire has achieved since then has delivered only moderate absoluteresults.Looking forward, we hope to average several points better than the S&P – though that result is, ofcourse, far from a sure thing. If we succeed in that aim, we will almost certainly produce better relative results inbad years for the stock market and suffer poorer results in strong markets. 4Berkshire’s Corporate Performance vs. the S&P 500 by Five-Year Periods

5Intrinsic Value – Today and TomorrowThough Berkshire’s intrinsic value cannot be precisely calculated, two of its three key pillars can bemeasured. Charlie and I rely heavily on these measurements when we make our own estimates of Berkshire’svalue.The first component of value is our investments: stocks, bonds and cash equivalents. At yearend thesetotaled $158 billion at market value.Insurance float – money we temporarily hold in our insurance operations that does not belong to us –funds $66 billion of our investments. This float is “free” as long as insurance underwriting breaks even, meaningthat the premiums we receive equal the losses and expenses we incur. Of course, underwriting results are volatile,swinging erratically between profits and losses. Over our entire history, though, we’ve been significantlyprofitable, and I also expect us to average breakeven results or better in the future. If we do that, all of ourinvestments – those funded both by float and by retained earnings – can be viewed as an element of value forBerkshire shareholders.Berkshire’s second component of value is earnings that come from sources other than investments andinsurance underwriting. These earnings are delivered by our 68 non-insurance companies, itemized on page 106.In Berkshire’s early years, we focused on the investment side. During the past two decades, however, we’veincreasingly emphasized the development of earnings from non-insurance businesses, a practice that willcontinue.The following tables illustrate this shift. In the first table, we present per-share investments at decadeintervals beginning in 1970, three years after we entered the insurance business. We exclude those investmentsapplicable to minority interests.Yearend

6For the forty years, our compounded annual gain in pre-tax, non-insurance earnings per share is 21.0%.During the same period, Berkshire’s stock price increased at a rate of 22.1% annually. Over time, you can expectour stock price to move in rough tandem with Berkshire’s investments and earnings. Market price and intrinsicvalue often follow very different paths – sometimes for extended periods – but eventually they meet.There is a third, more subjective, element to an intrinsic value calculation that can be either positive ornegative: the efficacy with which retained earnings will be deployed in the future. We, as well as many otherbusinesses, are likely to retain earnings over the next decade that will equal, or even exceed, the capital we presentlyemploy. Some companies will turn these retained dolla rs into fifty-cent pieces, others into two-dollar bills.This “what-will-they-do-with-the-money” factor must always be evaluated along with the“what-do-we-have-now” calculation in order for us, or anybody, to arrive at a sensible estimate of a company’sintrinsic value. That’s because an outside investor stands by helplessly as management reinvests his share of thecompany’s earnings. If a CEO can be expected to do this job well, the reinvestment prospects add to thecompany’s current value; if the CEO’s talents or motives are suspect, today’s value must be discounted. Thedifference in outcome can be huge. A dollar of then-value in the hands of Sears Roebuck’s or MontgomeryWard’s CEOs in the late 1960s had a far different destiny than did a dollar entrusted to Sam Walton.************Charlie and I hope that the per-share earnings of our non-insurance businesses continue to increase at adecent rate. But the job gets tougher as the numbers get larger. We will need both good performance from ourcurrent businesses and moremajoracquisitions. We’re prepared. Our elephant gun has been reloaded, and mytrigger finger is itchy.Partially offsetting our anchor of size are several important advantages we have. First, we possess acadre of truly skilled managers who have an unusual commitment to their own operations and to Berkshire.Many of our CEOs are independently wealthy and work only because they love what they do. They arevolunteers, not mercenaries. Because no one can offer them a job they would enjoy more, they can’t be luredaway.At Berkshire, managers can focus on running their businesses: They are not subjected to meetings atheadquarters nor financing worries nor Wall Street harassment. They simply get a letter from me every two years(it’s reproduced on pages 104-105) and call me when they wish. And their wishes do differ: There are managersto whom I have not talked in the last year, while there is one with whom I talk almost daily. Our trust is in peoplerather than process. A “hire well, manage little” code suits both them and me.Berkshire’s CEOs come in many forms. Some have MBAs; others never finished college. Some usebudgets and are by-the-book types; others operate by the seat of their pants. Our team resembles a baseball squadcomposed of all-stars having vastly different batting styles. Changes in our line-up are seldom required.Our second advantage relates to the allocation of the money our businesses earn. After meeting theneeds of those businesses, we have very substantial sums left over. Most companies limit themselves toreinvesting funds within the industry in which they have been operating. That often restricts them, however, to a“universe” for capital allocation that is both tiny and quite inferior to what is available in the wider world.Competition for the few opportunities thatareavailable tends to become fierce. The seller has the upper hand, asa girl might if she were the only female at a party attended by many boys. That lopsided situation would be greatfor the girl, but terrible for the boys.At Berkshire we face no institutional restraints when we deploy capital. Charlie and I are limited onlyby our ability to understand the likely future of a possible acquisition. If we clear that hurdle – and frequently wecan’t – we are then able to compare any one opportunity against a host of others.
7When I took control of Berkshire in 1965, I didn’t exploit this advantage. Berkshire was then only intextiles, where it had in the previous decade lost significant money. The dumbest thing I could have done was topursue “opportunities” to improve and expand the existing textile operation – so for years that’s exactly what Idid. And then, in a final burst of brilliance, I went out and bought anothertextile company. Aaaaaaargh! Eventually I came to my senses, heading first into insurance and then into other industries.There is even a supplement to this world-is-our-oyster advantage: In addition to evaluating theattractions of one business against a host of others, we also measure businesses against opportunities available inmarketable securities, a comparison most managements don’t make. Often, businesses are priced ridiculouslyhigh against what can likely be earned from investments in stocks or bonds. At such moments, we buy securitiesand bide our time.Our flexibility in respect to capital allocation has accounted for much of our progress to date. We havebeen able to take money we earn from, say, See’s Candies or Business Wire (two of our best-run businesses, butalso two offering limited reinvestment opportunities) and use it as part of the stake we needed to buy BNSF.Our final advantage is the hard-to-duplicate culture that permeates Berkshire. And in businesses,culture counts.To start with, the directors who represent you think and act like owners. They receive tokencompensation: no options, no restricted stock and, for that matter, virtually no cash. We do not provide themdirectors and officers liability insurance, a given at almost every other large public company. If they mess upwith your money, they will lose their money as well. Leaving my holdings aside, directors and their families ownBerkshire shares worth more than $3 billion. Our directors, therefore, monitor Berkshire’s actions and resultswith keen interest and an owner’s eye. You and I are lucky to have them as stewards.This same owner-orientation prevails among our managers. In many cases, these are people who havesought out Berkshire as an acquirer for a business that they and their families have long owned. They came to uswith an owner’s mindset, and we provide an environment that encourages them to retain it. Having managerswho love their businesses is no small advantage.Cultures self-propagate. Winston Churchill once said, “You shape your houses and then they shapeyou.” That wisdom applies to businesses as well. Bureaucratic procedures beget more bureaucracy, and imperialcorporate palaces induce imperious behavior. (As one wag put it, “You know you’re no longer CEO when youget in the back seat of your car and it doesn’t move.”) At Berkshire’s “World Headquarters” our annual rent is$270,212. Moreover, the home-office investment in furniture, art, Coke dispenser, lunch room, high-techequipment – you name it – totals $301,363. As long as Charlie and I treat your money as if it were our own,Berkshire’s managers are likely to be careful with it as well.Our compensation programs, our annual meeting and even our annual reports are all designed with aneye to reinforcing the Berkshire culture, and making it one that will repel and expel managers of a different bent.This culture grows stronger every year, and it will remain intact long after Charlie and I have left the scene.We will need all of the strengths I’ve just described to do reasonably well. Our managers will deliver;you can count on that. But whether Charlie and I can hold up our end in capital allocation depends in part on thecompetitive environment for acquisitions. You will get our best efforts.GEICONow let me tell you a story that will help you understand how the intrinsic value of a business can farexceed its book value. Relating this tale also gives me a chance to relive some great memories.Sixty years ago last month, GEICO entered my life, destined to shape it in a huge way. I was then a20-year-old graduate student at Columbia, having elected to go there because my hero, Ben Graham, taught aonce-a-week class at the school. 8One day at the library, I checked out Ben’s entry in Who’s Who in America and found he waschairman of Government Employees Insurance Co. (now called GEICO). I knew nothing of insurance and hadnever heard of the company. The librarian, however, steered me to a large compendium of insurers and, afterreading the page on GEICO, I decided to visit the company. The following Saturday, I boarded an early train forWashington.Alas, when I arrived at the company’s headquarters, the building was closed. I then rather franticallystarted pounding on a door, until finally a janitor appeared. I asked him if there was anyone in the office I couldtalk to, and he steered me to the only person around, Lorimer Davidson.That was my lucky moment. During the next four hours, “Davy” gave me an education about bothinsurance and GEICO. It was the beginning of a wonderful friendship. Soon thereafter, I graduated fromColumbia and became a stock salesman in Omaha. GEICO, of course, was my prime recommendation, which gotme off to a great start with dozens of customers. GEICO also jump-started my net worth because, soon aftermeeting Davy, I made the stock 75% of my $9,800 investment portfolio. (Even so, I felt over-diversified.) Subsequently, Davy became CEO of GEICO, taking the company to undreamed-of heights before it gotinto trouble in the mid-1970s, a few years after his retirement. When that happened – with the stock falling bymore than 95% – Berkshire bought about one-third of the company in the market, a position that over the yearsincreased to 50% because of GEICO’s repurchases of its own shares. Berkshire’s cost for this half of the businesswas $46 million. (Despite the size of our position, we exercised no control over operations.)We then purchased the remaining 50% of GEICO at the beginning of 1996, which spurred Davy, at 95,to make a video tape saying how happy he was that his beloved GEICO would permanently reside withBerkshire. (He also playfully concluded with, “Next time, Warren, please make an appointment.”)A lot has happened at GEICO during the last 60 years, but its core goal – saving Americans substantialmoney on their purchase of auto insurance – remains unchanged. (Try us at 1-800-847-7536 orwww.GEICO.com.) In other words, get the policyholder’s business by deservinghis business. Focusing on this objective, the company has grown to be America’s third-largest auto insurer, with a market share of 8.8%.When Tony Nicely, GEICO’s CEO, took over in 1993, that share was 2.0%, a level at which it hadbeen stuck for more than a decade. GEICO became a different company under Tony, finding a path to consistentgrowth while simultaneously maintaining underwriting discipline and keeping its costs low.Let me quantify Tony’s achievement. When, in 1996, we bought the 50% of GEICO we didn’t alreadyown, it cost us about $2.3 billion. That price implied a value of $4.6 billion for 100%. GEICO then had tangiblenet worth of $1.9 billion.The excess over tangible net worth of the implied value – $2.7 billion – was what we estimatedGEICO’s “goodwill” to be worth at that time. That goodwill represented the economic value of the policyholderswho were then doing business with GEICO. In 1995, those customers had paid the company $2.8 billion inpremiums. Consequently, we were valuing GEICO’s customers at about 97% (2.7/2.8) of what they wereannually paying the company. By industry standards, that was a very high price. But GEICO was no ordinaryinsurer: Because of the company’s low costs, its policyholders were consistently profitable and unusually loyal.Today, premium volume is $14.3 billion and growing. Yet we carry the goodwill of GEICO on ourbooks at only $1.4 billion, an amount that will remain unchanged no matter how much the value of GEICOincreases. (Under accounting rules, you write down the carrying value of goodwill if its economic valuedecreases, but leave it unchanged if economic value increases.) Using the 97%-of-premium-volume yardstick weapplied to our 1996 purchase, the real value today of GEICO’s economic goodwill is about $14 billion. And thisvalue is likely to be much higher ten and twenty years from now. GEICO – off to a strong start in 2011 – is thegift that keeps giving.9One not-so-small footnote: Under Tony, GEICO has developed one of the country’s largest personal-lines insuranceagencies, which primarily sells homeowners policies to our GEICO auto insurance customers. Inthis business, we represent a number of insurers that are not affiliated with us. They take the risk; we simply signup the customers. Last year we sold 769,898 new policies at this agency operation, up 34% from the year before.The obvious way this activity aids us is that it produces commission revenue; equally important is the fact that itfurther strengthens our relationship with our policyholders, helping us retain them.I owe an enormous debt to Tony and Davy (and, come to think of it, to that janitor as well).************Now, let’s examine the four major sectors of Berkshire. Each has vastly different balance sheet andincome characteristics from the others. Lumping them together therefore impedes analysis. So we’ll present themas four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them.We will look first at insurance, Berkshire’s core operation and the engine that has propelled ourexpansion over the years.InsuranceProperty-casualty (“P/C”) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases,such as those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. Thiscollect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go toothers. Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire’s benefit. Though individual policies and claimscome and go, the amount of float we hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume.Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how we have grown: Just take a look at thefollowing table:Yearend
Float(in $ millions)
1970........................................ $ 3 91980........................................ 2 3 71990........................................ 1,632 2000........................................ 27,871 2010........................................ 65,832 If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profitthat adds to the investment income that our float produces. When such a profit occurs, we enjoy the use of freemoney – and, better yet, getpaidfor holding it. Alas, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result createsintense competition, so vigorous in most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at asignificant underwritingloss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, StateFarm, by far the country’s largest insurer and a well-managed company, has incurred an underwriting loss inseven of the last ten years. During that period, its aggregate underwriting loss was more than $20 billion.At Berkshire, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for eight consecutive years, our totalunderwriting gain for the period having been $17 billion. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwriteprofitably in most – though certainly not all – future years. If we accomplish that, our float will be better thancost-free. We will benefit just as we would if some party deposited $66 billion with us, paid us a fee for holdingits money and then let us invest its funds for our own benefit.
10Let me emphasize again that cost-free float isnotan outcome to be expected for the P/C industry as a whole: In most years, industry premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, theindustry’s overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized byAmerican industry, a sorry performance almost certain to continue. Berkshire’s outstanding economics exist onlybecause we have some terrific managers running some unusual businesses. We’ve already told you about GEICO,but we have two other very large operations, and a bevy of smaller ones as well, each a star in its own way.************First off is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, run by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks that no oneelse has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, mostimportantly, brains in a manner that is unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risksthat are inappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are farmore conservative than most large insurers in that respect. In the past year, Ajit has significantly increased his life reinsurance operation, developing annualpremium volume of about $2 billion that will repeat for decades.From a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $30 billion andsignificant underwriting profits, a feat that no CEO of any other insurer has come close to matching. By hisaccomplishments, he has added a great many billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire. Even kryptonitebounces off Ajit.************We have another insurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.At bottom, a sound insurance operation requires four disciplines: (1) An understanding of allexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) A conservative evaluation of the likelihood of any exposure actuallycausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) The setting of a premium that will deliver a profit, on average,after both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) The willingness to walk away if theappropriate premium can’t be obtained.Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. The urgings of Wall Street, pressures fromthe agency force and brokers, or simply a refusal by a testosterone-driven CEO to accept shrinking volumes hasled too many insurers to write business at inadequate prices. “The other guy is doing it so we must as well” spellstrouble in any business, but none more so than insurance.Tad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re’s hugefloat has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, it will continue to be.************Finally, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them specializing in odd corners of theinsurance world. In aggregate, their results have consistently been profitable and, as the table below shows, thefloat they provide us is substantial. Charlie and I treasure these companies and their managers.Here is the record of all four segments of our property-casualty and life insurance businesses:Underwriting Profit

*Does not include purchase-accounting adjustments.This group of companies sells products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of the businessesenjoy terrific economics, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangibleassets that run from 25% after-tax to more than 100%. Others produce good returns in the area of 12-20%. Unfortunately, a few have very poorreturns, a result of some serious mistakes I have made in my job of capital allocation. These errors came aboutbecause I misjudged either the competitive strength of the business I was purchasing or the future economics ofthe industry in which it operated. I try to look out ten or twenty years when making an acquisition, but sometimesmy eyesight has been poor.Most of the companies in this section improved their earnings last year and four set records. Let’s lookfirst at the record-breakers.• TTI, our electronic components distributor, had sales 21% above its previous high (recorded in 2008)and pre-tax earnings that topped its earlier record by 58%. Its sales gains spanned three continents, withNorth America at 16%, Europe at 26%, and Asia at 50%. The thousands of items TTI distributes arepedestrian, many selling for less than a dollar. The magic of TTI’s exceptional performance is createdby Paul Andrews, its CEO, and his associates.
12• Forest River, our RV and boat manufacturer, had record sales of nearly $2 billion and record earningsas well. Forest River has 82 plants, and I have yet to visit one (or the home office, for that matter).There’s no need; Pete Liegl, the company’s CEO, runs a terrific operation. Come view his products atthe annual meeting. Better yet, buy one.• CTB, our farm-equipment company, again set an earnings record. I told you in the 2008 Annual Reportabout Vic Mancinelli, the company’s CEO. He just keeps getting better. Berkshire paid $140 millionfor CTB in 2002. It has since paid us dividends of $160 million and eliminated $40 million of debt.Last year it earned $106 million pre-tax. Productivity gains have produced much of this increase. Whenwe bought CTB, sales per employee were $189,365; now they are $405,878.• Would you believe shoes? H. H. Brown, run by Jim Issler and best known for its Born brand, set a newrecord for sales and earnings (helped by its selling 1,110 pairs of shoes at our annual meeting). Jim hasbrilliantly adapted to major industry changes. His work, I should mention, is overseen by FrankRooney, 89, a superb businessman and still a dangerous fellow with whom to have a bet on the golfcourse.A huge story in this sector’s year-to-year improvement occurred at NetJets. I can’t overstate thebreadth and importance of Dave Sokol’s achievements at this company, the leading provider of fractionalownership of jet airplanes. NetJets has long been an operational success, owning a 2010 market share five timesthat of its nearest competitor. Our overwhelming leadership stems from a wonderful team of pilots, mechanicsand service personnel. This crew again did its job in 2010, with customer satisfaction, as delineated in our regularsurveys, hitting new highs.Even though NetJets was consistently a runaway winner with customers, our financial results, since itsacquisition in 1998, were a failure. In the 11 years through 2009, the company reported an aggregate pre-tax lossof $157 million, a figure that was far understated since borrowing costs at NetJets were heavily subsidized by itsfree use of Berkshire’s credit. Had NetJets been operating on a stand-alone basis, its loss over the years wouldhave been several hundreds of millions greater.We are now charging NetJets an appropriate fee for Berkshire’s guarantee. Despite this fee (whichcame to $38 million in 2010), NetJets earned $207 million pre-tax in 2010, a swing of $918 million from 2009.Dave’s quick restructuring of management and the company’s rationalization of its purchasing and spendingpolicies has ended the hemorrhaging of cash and turned what was Berkshire’s only major business problem into asolidly profitable operation.Dave has meanwhile maintained NetJets’ industry-leading reputation for safety and service. In manyimportant ways, our training and operational standards are considerably stronger than those required by the FAA.Maintaining top-of-the-line standards is the right thing to do, but I also have a selfish reason for championing thispolicy. My family and I have flown more than 5,000 hours on NetJets (that’s equal to being airborne 24 hours aday for seven months) and will fly thousands of hours more in the future. We receive no special treatment andhave used a random mix of at least 100 planes and 300 crews. Whichever the plane or crew, we always know weare flying with the best-trained pilots in private aviation.The largest earner in our manufacturing, service and retailing sector is Marmon, a collection of 130businesses. We will soon increase our ownership in this company to 80% by carrying out our scheduled purchaseof 17% of its stock from the Pritzker family. The cost will be about $1.5 billion. We will then purchase theremaining Pritzker holdings in 2013 or 2014, whichever date is selected by the family. Frank Ptak runs Marmonwonderfully, and we look forward to 100% ownership.
13Next to Marmon, the two largest earners in this sector are Iscar and McLane. Both had excellent years.In 2010, Grady Rosier’s McLane entered the wine and spirits distribution business to supplement its $32 billionoperation as a distributor of food products, cigarettes, candy and sundries. In purchasing Empire Distributors, anoperator in Georgia and North Carolina, we teamed up with David Kahn, the company’s dynamic CEO. David isleading our efforts to expand geographically. By yearend he had already made his first acquisition, Horizon Wineand Spirits in Tennessee.At Iscar, profits were up 159% in 2010, and we may well surpass pre-recession levels in 2011. Salesare improving throughout the world, particularly in Asia. Credit Eitan Wertheimer, Jacob Harpaz and DannyGoldman for an exceptional performance, one far superior to that of Iscar’s main competitors.All that is good news. Our businesses related to home construction, however, continue to struggle.Johns Manville, MiTek, Shaw and Acme Brick have maintained their competitive positions, but their profits arefar below the levels of a few years ago. Combined, these operations earned $362 million pre-tax in 2010compared to $1.3 billion in 2006, and their employment has fallen by about 9,400.A housing recovery will probably begin within a year or so. In any event, it is certain to occur at somepoint. Consequently: (1) At MiTek, we have made, or committed to, five bolt-on acquisitions during the pasteleven months; (2) At Acme, we just recently acquired the leading manufacturer of brick in Alabama for$50 million; (3) Johns Manville is building a $55 million roofing membrane plant in Ohio, to be completed nextyear; and (4) Shaw will spend $200 million in 2011 on plant and equipment, all of it situated in America. Thesebusinesses entered the recession strong and will exit it stronger. At Berkshire, our time horizon is forever.Regulated, Capital-Intensive BusinessesWe have two very large businesses, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, with important commoncharacteristics that distinguish them from our many others. Consequently, we give them their own sector in thisletter and split out their financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.A key characteristic of both companies is the huge investment they have in very long-lived, regulatedassets, with these funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is not needed: Both businesses have earning power that, even under very adverse business conditions, amply coverstheir interest requirements. For example, in recessionary 2010 with BNSF’s car loadings far off peak levels, thecompany’s interest coverage was 6:1.Both companies are heavily regulated, and both will have a never-ending need to make majorinvestments in plant and equipment. Both also need to provide efficient, customer-satisfying service to earn therespect of their communities and regulators. In return, both need to be assured that they will be allowed to earnreasonable earnings on future capital investments.Earlier I explained just how important railroads are to our country’s future. Rail moves 42% ofAmerica’s inter-city freight, measured by ton-miles, and BNSF moves more than any other railroad – about 28%of the industry total. A little math will tell you that more than 11% of allinter-city ton-miles of freight in the U.S. is transported by BNSF. Given the shift of population to the West, our share may well inch higher.All of this adds up to a huge responsibility. We are a major and essential part of the Americaneconomy’s circulatory system, obliged to constantly maintain and improve our 23,000 miles of track along withits ancillary bridges, tunnels, engines and cars. In carrying out this job, we must anticipate society’s needs, notmerely react to them. Fulfilling our societal obligation, we will regularly spend far more than our depreciation,with this excess amounting to $2 billion in 2011. I’m confident we will earn appropriate returns on our hugeincremental investments. Wise regulation and wise investment are two sides of the same coin.At MidAmerican, we participate in a similar “social compact.” We are expected to put up ever-increasing sums to satisfy the future needs of our customers. If we meanwhile operate reliably and efficiently, weknow that we will obtain a fair return on these investments. 14MidAmerican supplies 2.4 million customers in the U.S. with electricity, operating as the largestsupplier in Iowa, Wyoming and Utah and as an important provider in other states as well. Our pipelines transport8% of the country’s natural gas. Obviously, many millions of Americans depend on us every day.MidAmerican has delivered outstanding results for both its owners (Berkshire’s interest is 89.8%) and itscustomers. Shortly after MidAmerican purchased Northern Natural Gas pipeline in 2002, that company’sperformance as a pipeline was rated dead last, 43 out of 43, by the leading authority in the field. In the most recentreport published, Northern Natural was ranked second. The top spot was held by our other pipeline, Kern River.In its electric business, MidAmerican has a comparable record. Iowa rates have not increased since wepurchased our operation there in 1999. During the same period, the other major electric utility in the state hasraised prices more than 70% and now has rates far above ours. In certain metropolitan areas in which the twoutilities operate side by side, electric bills of our customers run far below those of their neighbors. I am told thatcomparable houses sell at higher prices in these cities if they are located in our service area.MidAmerican will have 2,909 megawatts of wind generation in operation by the end of 2011, morethan any other regulated electric utility in the country. The total amount that MidAmerican has invested orcommitted to wind is a staggering $5.4 billion. We can make this sort of investment because MidAmericanretainsallof its earnings, unlike other utilities that generally pay out most of what they earn.As you can tell by now, I am proud of what has been accomplished for our society by Matt Rose atBNSF and by David Sokol and Greg Abel at MidAmerican. I am also both proud and grateful for what they haveaccomplished for Berkshire shareholders. Below are the relevant figures:MidAmerican

15Finance and Financial ProductsThis, our smallest sector, includes two rental companies, XTRA (trailers) and CORT (furniture), andClayton Homes, the country’s leading producer and financer of manufactured homes.Both of our leasing businesses improved their performances last year, albeit from a very low base.XTRA increased the utilization of its equipment from 63% in 2009 to 75% in 2010, thereby raising pre-taxearnings to $35 million from $17 million in 2009. CORT experienced a pickup in business as the year progressedand also significantly tightened its operations. The combination increased its pre-tax results from a loss of$3 million in 2009 to $18 million of profit in 2010.At Clayton, we produced 23,343 homes, 47% of the industry’s total of 50,046. Contrast this to the peakyear of 1998, when 372,843 homes were manufactured. (We then had an industry share of 8%.) Sales would havebeen terrible last year under any circumstances, but the financing problems I commented upon in the 2009 reportcontinue to exacerbate the distress. To explain: Home-financing policies of our government, expressed throughthe loans found acceptable by FHA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, favor site-built homes and work to negate theprice advantage that manufactured homes offer.We finance more manufactured-home buyers than any other company. Our experience, therefore,should be instructive to those parties preparing to overhaul our country’s home-loan practices. Let’s take a look.Clayton owns 200,804 mortgages that it originated. (It also has some mortgage portfolios that itpurchased.) At the origination of these contracts, the average FICO score of our borrowers was 648, and 47%were 640 or below. Your banker will tell you that people with such scores are generally regarded as questionablecredits.Nevertheless, our portfolio has performed well during conditions of stress. Here’s our loss experienceduring the last five years for originated loans:Year

But they want to stay in their homes, and generally they borrowed sensible amountsin relation to their income. In addition, we were keeping the originated mortgages for our own account, whichmeans we were not securitizing or otherwise reselling them. If we were stupid in our lending, wewere going to pay the price. That concentrates the mind.If home buyers throughout the country had behaved like our buyers, America would not have had thecrisis that it did. Our approach was simply to get a meaningful down-payment and gear fixedmonthly payments to a sensible percentage of income. This policy kept Clayton solvent and also kept buyers in their homes.Home ownership makes sense for most Americans, particularly at today’s lower prices and bargaininterest rates. All things considered, the third best investment I ever made was the purchase of my home, though Iwould have made far more money had I instead rented and used the purchase money to buy stocks. (The two bestinvestments were wedding rings.) For the $31,500 I paid for our house, my family and I gained 52 years ofterrific memories with more to come.
16But a house can be a nightmare if the buyer’s eyes are bigger than his wallet and if a lender – oftenprotected by a government guarantee – facilitates his fantasy. Our country’s social goal should not be to putfamilies into the house of their dreams, but rather to put them into a house they can afford.InvestmentsBelow we show our common stock investments that at yearend had a market value of more than$1 billion. 12/31/10Shares

*This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP “cost” differs in a few cases because ofwrite-ups or write-downs that have been required.In our reported earnings we reflect only the dividends our portfolio companies pay us. Our share of theundistributed earnings of these investees, however, was more than $2 billion last year. These retained earningsare important. In our experience – and, for that matter, in the experience of investors over the past century –undistributed earnings have been either matched or exceeded by market gains, albeit in a highly irregular manner.(Indeed, sometimes the correlation goes in reverse. As one investor said in 2009: “This is worse than divorce.I’ve lost half my net worth – and I still have my wife.”) In the future, we expect our market gains to eventually atleast equal the earnings our investees retain.************In our earlier estimate of Berkshire’s normal earning power, we made three adjustments that relate tofuture investment income (but didnotinclude anything for the undistributed earnings factor I have justdescribed).The first adjustment was decidedly negative. Last year, we discussed five large fixed-incomeinvestments that have been contributing substantial sums to our reported earnings. One of these – our Swiss Renote – was redeemed in the early days of 2011, and two others – our Goldman Sachs and General Electricpreferred stocks – are likely to be gone by yearend. General Electric is entitled to call our preferred in Octoberand has stated its intention to do so. Goldman Sachs has the right to call our preferred on 30 days notice, but hasbeen held back by the Federal Reserve (bless it!), which unfortunately will likely give Goldman the green lightbefore long. 17All three of the companies redeeming must pay us a premium to do so – in aggregate about $1.4 billion –but all of the redemptions are nevertheless unwelcome. After they occur, our earning power will be significantlyreduced. That’s the bad news.There are two probable offsets. At yearend we held $38 billion of cash equivalents that have beenearning a pittance throughout 2010. At some point, however, better rates will return. They will add at least$500 million – and perhaps much more – to our investment income. That sort of increase in money-market yieldsis unlikely to come soon. It is appropriate, nevertheless, for us to include improved rates in an estimate of“normal” earning power. Even before higher rates come about, furthermore, we could get lucky and find anopportunity to use some of our cash hoard at decent returns. That day can’t come too soon for me: To updateAesop, a girl in a convertible is worth five in the phone book.In addition, dividends on our current common stock holdings will almost certainly increase. The largestgain is likely to come at Wells Fargo. The Federal Reserve, our friend in respect to Goldman Sachs, has frozendividend levels at major banks, whether strong or weak, during the last two years. Wells Fargo, thoughconsistently prospering throughout the worst of the recession and currently enjoying enormous financial strengthand earning power, has therefore been forced to maintain an artificially low payout. (We don’t fault the Fed: Forvarious reasons, an across-the-board freeze made sense during the crisis and its immediate aftermath.)At some point, probably soon, the Fed’s restrictions will cease. Wells Fargo can then reinstate therational dividend policy that its owners deserve. At that time, we would expect our annual dividends from justthis one security to increase by several hundreds of millions of dollars annually.Other companies we hold are likely to increase their dividends as well. Coca-Cola paid us $88 millionin 1995, the year after we finished purchasing the stock. Every year since, Coke has increased its dividend. In2011, we will almost certainly receive $376 million from Coke, up $24 million from last year. Within ten years, Iwould expect that $376 million to double. By the end of that period, I wouldn’t be surprised to see our share ofCoke’sannualearnings exceed 100% of what we paid for the investment. Time is the friend of the wonderfulbusiness.Overall, I believe our “normal” investment income will at least equal what we realized in 2010, thoughthe redemptions I described will cut our take in 2011 and perhaps 2012 as well.************Last summer, Lou Simpson told me he wished to retire. Since Lou was a mere 74 – an age Charlie andI regard as appropriate only for trainees at Berkshire – his call was a surprise.Lou joined GEICO as its investment manager in 1979, and his service to that company has beeninvaluable. In the 2004 Annual Report, I detailed his record with equities, and I have omitted updates onlybecause his performance made mine look bad. Who needs that?Lou has never been one to advertise his talents. But I will: Simply put, Lou is one of the investmentgreats. We will miss him.************Four years ago, I told you that we needed to add one or more younger investment managers to carry onwhen Charlie, Lou and I weren’t around. At that time we had multiple outstanding candidates immediatelyavailable for my CEO job (as we do now), but we did not have backup in the investment area.It’s easy to identify many investment managers with great recent records. But past results, thoughimportant, do not suffice when prospective performance is being judged. How the record has been achieved iscrucial, as is the manager’s understanding of – and sensitivity to – risk (which in no way should be measured bybeta, the choice of too many academics). In respect to the risk criterion, we were looking for someone with ahard-to-evaluate skill: the ability to anticipate the effects of economic scenarios not previously observed. Finally,we wanted someone who would regard working for Berkshire as far more than a job. 18When Charlie and I met Todd Combs, we knew he fit our requirements. Todd, as was the case withLou, will be paid a salary plus a contingent payment based on his performance relative to the S&P. We havearrangements in place for deferrals and carryforwards that will prevent see-saw performance being met byundeserved payments. The hedge-fund world has witnessed some terrible behavior by general partners who havereceived huge payouts on the upside and who then, when bad results occurred, have walked away rich, with theirlimited partners losing back their earlier gains. Sometimes these same general partners thereafter quickly startedanother fund so that they could immediately participate in future profits without having to overcome their pastlosses. Investors who put money with such managers should be labeled patsies, not partners.As long as I am CEO, I will continue to manage the great majority of Berkshire’s holdings, both bondsand equities. Todd initially will manage funds in the range of one to three billion dollars, an amount he can resetannually. His focus will be equities but he is not restricted to that form of investment. (Fund consultants like torequire style boxes such as “long-short,” “macro,” “international equities.” At Berkshire our only style box is“smart.”)Over time, we may add one or two investment managers if we find the right individuals. Should we dothat, we will probably have 80% of each manager’s performance compensation be dependent on his or her ownportfolio and 20% on that of the other manager(s). We want a compensation system that pays off big forindividual success but that also fosters cooperation, not competition.When Charlie and I are no longer around, our investment manager(s) will have responsibility for theentire portfolio in a manner then set by the CEO and Board of Directors. Because good investors bring a usefulperspective to the purchase of businesses, we would expect them to be consulted – but not to have a vote – on thewisdom of possible acquisitions. In the end, of course, the Board will make the call on any major acquisition.One footnote: When we issued a press release about Todd’s joining us, a number of commentatorspointed out that he was “little-known” and expressed puzzlement that we didn’t seek a “big-name.” I wonderhow many of them would have known of Lou in 1979, Ajit in 1985, or, for that matter, Charlie in 1959. Our goalwas to find a 2-year-old Secretariat, not a 10-year-old Seabiscuit. (Whoops – that may not be the smartestmetaphor for an 80-year-old CEO to use.)DerivativesTwo years ago, in the 2008 Annual Report, I told you that Berkshire was a party to 251 derivativescontracts (other than those used for operations at our subsidiaries, such as MidAmerican, and the few left over atGen Re). Today, the comparable number is 203, a figure reflecting both a few additions to our portfolio and theunwinding or expiration of some contracts.Our continuing positions, all of which I am personally responsible for, fall largely into two categories.We view both categories as engaging us in insurance-like activities in which we receive premiums for assumingrisks that others wish to shed. Indeed, the thought processes we employ in these derivatives transactions areidentical to those we use in our insurance business. You should also understand that we get paid up-front whenwe enter into the contracts and therefore run no counterparty risk. That’s important.Our first category of derivatives consists of a number of contracts, written in 2004-2008, that requiredpayments by us if there were bond defaults by companies included in certain high-yield indices. With minorexceptions, we were exposed to these risks for five years, with each contract covering 100 companies.In aggregate, we received premiums of $3.4 billion for these contracts. When I originally told you inour 2007 Annual Report about them, I said that I expected the contracts would deliver us an “underwritingprofit,” meaning that our losses would be less than the premiums we received. In addition, I said we wouldbenefit from the use of float. 19Subsequently, as you know too well, we encountered both a financial panic and a severe recession. Anumber of the companies in the high-yield indices failed, which required us to pay losses of $2.5 billion. Today,however, our exposure is largely behind us because most of our higher-risk contracts have expired. Consequently, itappears almost certain that we will earn an underwriting profit as we originally anticipated. In addition, we have hadthe use of interest-free float that averaged about $2 billion over the life of the contracts. In short, we charged theright premium, and that protected us when business conditions turned terrible three years ago.Our other large derivatives position – whose contracts go by the name of “equity puts” – involvesinsurance we wrote for parties wishing to protect themselves against a possible decline in equity prices in theU.S., U.K., Europe and Japan. These contracts are tied to various equity indices, such as the S&P 500 in the U.S.and the FTSE 100 in the U.K. In the 2004-2008 period, we received $4.8 billion of premiums for 47 of thesecontracts, most of which ran for 15 years. On these contracts, only the price of the indices on the termination datecounts: No payments can be required before then.As a first step in updating you about these contracts, I can report that late in 2010, at the instigation ofour counterparty, we unwound eight contracts, all of them due between 2021 and 2028. We had originallyreceived $647 million in premiums for these contracts, and the unwinding required us to pay $425 million.Consequently, we realized a gain of $222 million and also had the interest-free and unrestricted use of that$647 million for about three years.Those 2010 transactions left us with 39 equity put contracts remaining on our books at yearend. Onthese, at their initiation, we received premiums of $4.2 billion.The future of these contracts is, of course, uncertain. But here is one perspective on them. If the pricesof the relevant indices are the same at the contract expiration dates as these prices were on December 31, 2010 –and foreign exchange rates are unchanged – we would owe $3.8 billion on expirations occurring from 2018 to2026. You can call this amount “settlement value.”On our yearend balance sheet, however, we carry the liability for those remaining equity puts at$6.7 billion. In other words, if the prices of the relevant indices remain unchanged from that date, we will recorda $2.9 billion gain in the years to come, that being the difference between the liability figure of $6.7 billion andthe settlement value of $3.8 billion. I believe that equity prices will very likely increase and that our liability willfall significantly between now and settlement date. If so, our gain from this point will be even greater. But that,of course, is far from a sure thing.What is sure is that we will have the use of our remaining “float” of $4.2 billion for an average of about10 more years. (Neither this float nor that arising from the high-yield contracts is included in the insurance floatfigure of $66 billion.) Since money is fungible, think of a portion of these funds as contributing to the purchaseof BNSF.As I have told you before, almost all of our derivatives contracts are free of any obligation to postcollateral – a fact that cut the premiums we could otherwise have charged. But that fact also left us feelingcomfortable during the financial crisis, allowing us in those days to commit to some advantageous purchases.Foregoing some additional derivatives premiums proved to be well worth it.On Reporting and Misreporting: The Numbers That Count and Those That Don’tEarlier in this letter, I pointed out some numbers that Charlie and I find useful in valuing Berkshire andmeasuring its progress.Let’s focus here on a number we omitted, but which many in the media feature above all others: netincome. Important though that number may be at most companies, it is almost always meaninglessat Berkshire. Regardless of how our businesses might be doing, Charlie and I could – quite legally – cause net income in anygiven period to be almost any number we would like. 20We have that flexibility becauserealizedgains or losses on investments go into the net income figure, whereasunrealizedgains (and, in most cases, losses) are excluded. For example, imagine that Berkshire had a$10 billion increase in unrealized gains in a given year and concurrently had $1 billion of realized losses. Our netincome – which would count only the loss – would be reported as lessthan our operating income. If we had meanwhile realized gains in thepreviousyear, headlines might proclaim that our earnings were down X% whenin reality our business might be much improved.If we really thought net income important, we could regularly feed realized gains into it simply becausewe have a huge amount of unrealized gains upon which to draw. Rest assured, though, that Charlie and I haveneversold a security because of the effect a sale would have on the net income we were soon to report. We bothhave a deep disgust for “game playing” with numbers, a practice that was rampant throughout corporate Americain the 1990s and still persists, though it occurs less frequently and less blatantly than it used to.Operating earnings, despite having some shortcomings, are in general a reasonable guide as to how ourbusinesses are doing. Ignore our net income figure, however. Regulations require that we report it to you. But ifyou find reporters focusing on it, that will speak more to their performance than ours.Both realized and unrealized gains and losses are fully reflected in the calculation of our book value.Pay attention to the changes in that metric and to the course of our operating earnings, and you will be on theright track.************As a p.s., I can’t resist pointing out just how capricious reported net income can be. Had our equity putshad a termination date of June 30, 2010, we would have been required to pay $6.4 billion to our counterparties atthat date. Security prices then generally rose in the next quarter, a move that brought the corresponding figuredown to $5.8 billion on September 30th. Yet the Black-Scholes formula that we use in valuing these contractsrequired us toincreaseour balance-sheet liability during this period from $8.9 billion to $9.6 billion, a changethat, after the effect of tax accruals, reduced our net income for the quarter by $455 million.Both Charlie and I believe that Black-Scholes produces wildly inappropriate values when applied tolong-dated options. We set out one absurd example in these pages two years ago. More tangibly, we put ourmoney where our mouth was by entering into our equity put contracts. By doing so, we implicitly asserted thatthe Black-Scholes calculations used by our counterparties or their customers were faulty.We continue, nevertheless, to use that formula in presenting our financial statements. Black-Scholes isthe accepted standard for option valuation – almost all leading business schools teach it – and we would beaccused of shoddy accounting if we deviated from it. Moreover, we would present our auditors with aninsurmountable problem were we to do that: They have clients who are our counterparties and who use Black-Scholes values for the same contracts we hold. It would be impossible for our auditors to attest to the accuracy ofboth their values and ours were the two far apart.Part of the appeal of Black-Scholes to auditors and regulators is that it produces a precise number.Charlie and I can’t supply one of those. We believe the true liability of our contracts to be far lower than thatcalculated by Black-Scholes, but we can’t come up with an exact figure – anymore than we can come up with aprecisevalue for GEICO, BNSF, or for Berkshire Hathaway itself. Our inability to pinpoint a number doesn’tbother us: We would rather be approximately right than precisely wrong.John Kenneth Galbraith once slyly observed that economists were most economical with ideas: Theymade the ones learned in graduate school last a lifetime. University finance departments often behave similarly.Witness the tenacity with which almost all clung to the theory of efficient markets throughout the 1970s and1980s, dismissively calling powerful facts that refuted it “anomalies.” (I always love explanations of that kind:The Flat Earth Society probably views a ship’s circling of the globe as an annoying, but inconsequential,anomaly.) 21Academics’ current practice of teaching Black-Scholes as revealed truth needs re-examination. For thatmatter, so does the academic’s inclination to dwell on the valuation of options. You can be highly successful asan investor without having the slightest ability to value an option. What students shouldbe learning is how to value a business. That’s what investing is all about.Life and DebtThe fundamental principle of auto racing is that to finish first, you must first finish. That dictum isequally applicable to business and guides our every action at Berkshire.Unquestionably, some people have become very rich through the use of borrowed money. However,that’s also been a way to get very poor. When leverage works, it magnifies your gains. Your spouse thinks you’reclever, and your neighbors get envious. But leverage is addictive. Once having profited from its wonders, veryfew people retreat to more conservative practices. And as we all learned in third grade – and some relearned in2008 – any series of positive numbers, however impressive the numbers may be, evaporates when multiplied by asingle zero. History tells us that leverage all too often produces zeroes, even when it is employed by very smartpeople.Leverage, of course, can be lethal to businesses as well. Companies with large debts often assume thatthese obligations can be refinanced as they mature. That assumption is usually valid. Occasionally, though, eitherbecause of company-specific problems or a worldwide shortage of credit, maturities must actually be met bypayment. For that, only cash will do the job.Borrowers then learn that credit is like oxygen. When either is abundant, its presence goes unnoticed.When either is missing, that’sallthat is noticed. Even a short absence of credit can bring a company to its knees.In September 2008, in fact, its overnight disappearance in many sectors of the economy came dangerously closeto bringing our entire country to its knees.Charlie and I havenointerest in any activity that could pose the slightest threat to Berkshire’s well-being. (With our having a combined age of 167, starting over is not on our bucket list.) We are forever consciousof the fact that you, our partners, have entrusted us with what in many cases is a major portion of your savings. Inaddition, important philanthropy is dependent on our prudence. Finally, many disabled victims of accidentscaused by our insureds are counting on us to deliver sums payable decades from now. It would be irresponsiblefor us to risk what all these constituencies need just to pursue a few points of extra return.A little personal history may partially explain our extreme aversion to financial adventurism. I didn’tmeet Charlie until he was 35, though he grew up within 100 yards of where I have lived for 52 years and alsoattended the same inner-city public high school in Omaha from which my father, wife, children and twograndchildren graduated. Charlie and I did, however, both work as young boys at my grandfather’s grocery store,though our periods of employment were separated by about five years. My grandfather’s name was Ernest, andperhaps no man was more aptly named. No one worked for Ernest, even as a stock boy, without being shaped bythe experience.On the facing page you can read a letter sent in 1939 by Ernest to his youngest son, my Uncle Fred.Similar letters went to his other four children. I still have the letter sent to my Aunt Alice, which I found – alongwith $1,000 of cash – when, as executor of her estate, I opened her safe deposit box in 1970.Ernest never went to business school – he never in fact finished high school – but he understood theimportance of liquidity as a condition forassuredsurvival. At Berkshire, we have taken his $1,000 solution a bit further and have pledged that we will hold at least $10 billion of cash, excluding that held at our regulated utilityand railroad businesses. Because of that commitment, we customarily keep at least $20 billion on hand so that wecan both withstand unprecedented insurance losses (our largest to date having been about $3 billion from Katrina,the insurance industry’s most expensive catastrophe) and quickly seize acquisition or investment opportunities,even during times of financial turmoil.2223We keep our cash largely in U.S. Treasury bills and avoid other short-term securities yielding a fewmore basis points, a policy we adhered to long before the frailties of commercial paper and money market fundsbecame apparent in September 2008. We agree with investment writer Ray DeVoe’s observation, “More moneyhas been lost reaching for yield than at the point of a gun.” At Berkshire, we don’t rely on bank lines, and wedon’t enter into contracts that could require postings of collateral except for amounts that are tiny in relation toour liquid assets.Furthermore, not a dime of cash has left Berkshire for dividends or share repurchases during the past40 years. Instead, we have retainedallof our earnings to strengthen our business, a reinforcement now runningabout $1 billion per month. Our net worth has thus increased from $48 million to $157 billion during those fourdecades and our intrinsic value has grown far more. No other American corporation has come close to buildingup its financial strength in this unrelenting way.By being so cautious in respect to leverage, we penalize our returns by a minor amount. Having loads ofliquidity, though, lets us sleep well. Moreover, during the episodes of financial chaos that occasionally erupt in oureconomy, we will be equipped both financially and emotionally to play offense while others scramble for survival.That’s what allowed us to invest $15.6 billion in 25 days of panic following the Lehman bankruptcy in 2008.The Annual MeetingThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, April 30
th. Carrie Kizer from our home office will be the ringmaster, and her theme this year is Planes, Trains and Automobiles. This gives NetJets, BNSF and BYD achance to show off.As always, the doors will open at the Qwest Center at 7 a.m., and a new Berkshire movie will be shown at8:30. At 9:30 we will go directly to the question-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest’sstands) will last until 3:30. After a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decideto leave during the day’s question periods, please do so while Charlieis talking. (Act fast; he can be terse.) The best reason to exit, of course, is toshop. We will help you do that by filling the 194,300-square- foot hall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you didyour part, and most locations racked up record sales. In a nine-hour period, we sold 1,053 pairs of Justin boots,12,416 pounds of See’s candy, 8,000 Dairy Queen Blizzards
®and 8,800 Quikut knives (that’s 16 knives per minute). But you can do better. Remember: Anyone who says money can’t buy happiness simply hasn’t learnedwhere to shop.GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all ofthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you ashareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which weoperate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that givencertain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money. Forat least half of you, I believe we can.Be sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry more than 60 books and DVDs, including the Chineselanguage edition of Poor Charlie’s Almanack, the ever-popular book about my partner. So what if you can’t readChinese? Just buy a copy and carry it around; it will make you look urbane and erudite. Should you need to shipyour book purchases, a shipping service will be available nearby.If you are a big spender – or merely a gawker – visit Elliott Aviation on the east side of the Omahaairport between noon and 5:00 p.m. on Saturday. There we will have a fleet of NetJets aircraft that will get yourpulse racing. Come by bus; leave by private jet.
24An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain thecredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. As for plane, hotel and car reservations,we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. Carol Pedersen, whohandles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it. Hotel rooms can be hard to find,but work with Carol and you will get one.Airlines have often jacked up prices – sometimes dramatically so – for the Berkshire weekend. If youare coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City versus Omaha. The drive is about 2
1⁄2hours and it may be that you can save significant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha.At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72

Last year the store did $33.3 million of businessduring its annual meeting sale, a volume that – as far as I know – exceeds the one-week total of anyretail store anyplace. To obtain the Berkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, April 26

The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 1st, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. On Sunday, around 1 p.m., I will be at Borsheimswith a smile and a shoeshine, selling jewelry just as I sold men’s shirts at J.C. Penney’s 63 years ago.I’ve told Susan Jacques, Borsheims’ CEO, that I’m still a hotshot salesman. But I see doubt in her eyes.So cut loose and buy something from me for your wife or sweetheart (presumably the same person). Make melook good.We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 25
ththrough Saturday, May 7th. During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement thatshows you are a Berkshire shareholder.On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion,will take on all comers – who will have their eyes wide open – in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, aremarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and SharonOsberg, two of the world’s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sundayafternoon.Gorat’s and Piccolo’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 1
st. Both will be serving until 10 p.m., with Gorat’s opening at 1 p.m. and Piccolo’s opening at 4 p.m. Theserestaurants are my favorites and – still being a growing boy – I will eat at both of them on Sunday evening.Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call 402-551-3733 on April 1
st(but not before) and at Piccolo’s call 402-342-9038.We will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period, askingCharlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mailaddresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be emailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com; Becky Quick, ofCNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com, and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, atarsorkin@nytimes.com.From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the dozen or so he or she decides are themost interesting and important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selectedif you keep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more thantwo questions in any email you send them. (In your email, let the journalist know if you would like your namementioned if your question is selected.)Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know thejournalists will pick some tough ones, and that’s the way we like it. 25We will again have a drawing at 8:15 a.m. on Saturday at each of 13 microphones for thoseshareholders wishing to ask questions themselves. At the meeting, I will alternate the questions asked by thejournalists with those from the winning shareholders. We hope to answer at least 60 questions. From ourstandpoint, the more the better. Our goal, which we pursue both through these annual letters and by our meetingdiscussions, is to give you a better understanding of the business that youown.************For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. Equally important,however, are the 20 men and women who work with me at our corporate office (all on one floor, which is theway we intend to keep it!).This group efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 14,097-page Federal income tax return along with state and foreign returns, responds to countless shareholder and mediainquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country’s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board’sactivities – and the list goes on and on.They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my lifeeasy and joyful. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: They deal with 48 universities(selected from 200 applicants) who will send students to Omaha this school year for a day with me and alsohandle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers for lunch. No CEO hasit better.This home office crew has my deepest thanks and deserves yours as well. Come to our Woodstock forCapitalism on April 30

26Memo
To:Berkshire Hathaway Managers (“The All-Stars”)cc:Berkshire DirectorsFrom:Warren E. BuffettDate:July 26, 2010This is my biennial letter to reemphasize Berkshire’s top priority and to get your help onsuccession planning (yours, not mine!).The priority is that all of us continue to zealously guard Berkshire’s reputation. We can’t beperfect but we can try to be. As I’ve said in these memos for more than 25 years: “We can afford to losemoney – even a lot of money. But we can’t afford to lose reputation – even a shred of reputation.” Wemustcontinue to measure every act against not only what is legal but also what we would be happy to havewritten about on the front page of a national newspaper in an article written by an unfriendly but intelligentreporter.Sometimes your associates will say “Everybody else is doing it.” This rationale is almost alwaysa bad one if it is the main justification for a business action. It is totally unacceptable when evaluating amoral decision. Whenever somebody offers that phrase as a rationale, in effect they are saying that theycan’t come up with agoodreason. If anyone gives this explanation, tell them to try using it with a reporteror a judge and see how far it gets them.If you see anything whose propriety or legality causes you to hesitate, be sure to give me a call.However, it’s very likely that if a given course of action evokes such hesitation, it’s too close to the lineand should be abandoned. There’s plenty of money to be made in the center of the court. If it’squestionable whether some action is close to the line, just assume it is outside and forget it.As a corollary, let me know promptly if there’s any significant bad news. I can handle bad newsbut I don’t like to deal with it after it has festered for awhile. A reluctance to face up immediately to badnews is what turned a problem at Salomon from one that could have easily been disposed of into one thatalmost caused the demise of a firm with 8,000 employees.
104Somebody is doing something today at Berkshire that you and I would be unhappy about if weknew of it. That’s inevitable: We now employ more than 250,000 people and the chances of that numbergetting through the day without any bad behavior occurring is nil. But we can have a huge effect inminimizing such activities by jumping on anything immediately when there is the slightest odor ofimpropriety. Your attitude on such matters, expressed by behavior as well as words, will be the mostimportant factor in how the culture of your business develops. Culture, more than rule books, determineshow an organization behaves.In other respects, talk to me about what is going on as little or as much as you wish. Each of youdoes a first-class job of running your operation with your own individual style and you don’t need me tohelp. The only items you need to clear with me are any changes in post-retirement benefits and anyunusually large capital expenditures or acquisitions.************I need your help in respect to the question of succession. I’m not looking for any of you to retireand I hope you all live to 100. (In Charlie’s case, 110.) But just in case you don’t, please send me a letter(at home if you wish) giving your recommendation as who should take over tomorrow if you shouldbecome incapacitated overnight. These letters will be seen by no one but me unless I’m no longer CEO, inwhich case my successor will need the information. Please summarize the strengths and weaknesses ofyour primary candidate as well as any possible alternates you may wish to include. Most of you haveparticipated in this exercise in the past and others have offered your ideas verbally. However, it’simportant to me to get a periodic update, and now that we have added so many businesses, I need to haveyour thoughts in writing rather than trying to carry them around in my memory. Of course, there are a fewoperations that are run by two or more of you – such as the Blumkins, the Merschmans, the pair at AppliedUnderwriters, etc. – and in these cases, just forget about this item. Your note can be short, informal,handwritten, etc. Just mark it “Personal for Warren.”Thanks for your help on all of this. And thanks for the way you run your businesses. You makemy job easy.WEB/dbP.S. Another minor request: Please turn down all proposals for me to speak, make contributions, intercedewith the Gates Foundation, etc. Sometimes these requests for you to act as intermediary will beaccompanied by “It can’t hurt to ask.” It will be easier for both of us if you just say “no.” As an addedfavor, don’t suggest that they instead write or call me. Multiply 76 businesses by the periodic “I think he’llbe interested in this one” and you can understand why it is better to say no firmly and immediately.

Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold atmarket rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire’sresults through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculatedusing the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-taxwhereas the Berkshire numbers areafter- tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, itsresults would have lagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded theS&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused theaggregate lag to be substantial.
2BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:The per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stock increased by 4.6% in 2011. Over thelast 47 years (that is, since present management took over), book value has grown from $19 to $99,860, a rate of19.8% compounded annually.*Charlie Munger, Berkshire’s Vice Chairman and my partner, and I feel good about the company’sprogress during 2011. Here are the highlights:• The primary job of a Board of Directors is to see that the right people are running the business and tobe sure that the next generation of leaders is identified and ready to take over tomorrow. I have been on 19 corporate boards, and Berkshire’s directors are at the top of the list in the time and diligence theyhave devoted to succession planning. What’s more, their efforts have paid off.As 2011 started, Todd Combs joined us as an investment manager, and shortly after yearend TedWeschler came aboard. Both of these men have outstanding investment skills and a deep commitmentto Berkshire. Each will be handling a few billion dollars in 2012, but they have the brains, judgmentand character to manage our entire portfolio when Charlie and I are no longer running Berkshire.Your Board is equally enthusiastic about my successor as CEO, an individual to whom they have had agreat deal of exposure and whose managerial and human qualities they admire. (We have two superbback-up candidates as well.) When a transfer of responsibility is required, it will be seamless, andBerkshire’s prospects will remain bright. More than 98% of my net worth is in Berkshire stock, all ofwhich will go to various philanthropies. Being so heavily concentrated in one stock defies conventionalwisdom. But I’m fine with this arrangement, knowing both the quality and diversity of the businesseswe own and the caliber of the people who manage them. With these assets, my successor will enjoy arunning start. Do not, however, infer from this discussion that Charlie and I are going anywhere; wecontinue to be in excellent health, and we love what we do.• On September 16
thwe acquired Lubrizol, a worldwide producer of additives and other specialtychemicals. The company has had an outstanding record since James Hambrick became CEO in 2004,with pre-tax profits increasing from $147 million to $1,085 million. Lubrizol will have manyopportunities for “bolt-on” acquisitions in the specialty chemical field. Indeed, we’ve already agreed tothree, costing $493 million. James is a disciplined buyer and a superb operator. Charlie and I are eagerto expand his managerial domain.• Our major businesses did well last year. In fact, eachof our five largest non-insurance companies – BNSF, Iscar, Lubrizol, Marmon Group and MidAmerican Energy – delivered record operating earnings. Inaggregate these businesses earned more than $9 billion pre-tax in 2011. Contrast that to seven years ago,when we owned only one of the five, MidAmerican, whose pre-tax earnings were $393 million. Unless theeconomy weakens in 2012,eachof our fabulous five should again set a record, with aggregate earningscomfortably topping $10 billion.
* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are1/1500
thof those shown for A.3• In total, our entire string of operating companies spent $8.2 billion for property, plant and equipment in2011, smashing our previous record by more than $2 billion. About 95% of these outlays were made inthe U.S., a fact that may surprise those who believe our country lacks investment opportunities. Wewelcome projects abroad, but expect the overwhelming majority of Berkshire’s future capitalcommitments to be in America. In 2012, these expenditures will again set a record.• Our insurance operations continued their delivery of costless capital that funds a myriad of otheropportunities. This business produces “float” – money that doesn’t belong to us, but that we get toinvest for Berkshire’s benefit. And if we pay out less in losses and expenses than we receive inpremiums, we additionally earn an underwriting profit, meaning the float costs us less than nothing.Though we are sure to have underwriting losses from time to time, we’ve now had nine consecutiveyears of underwriting profits, totaling about $17 billion. Over the same nine years our float increasedfrom $41 billion to its current record of $70 billion. Insurance has been good to us.• Finally, we made two major investments in marketable securities: (1) a $5 billion 6% preferred stock ofBank of America that came with warrants allowing us to buy 700 million common shares at $7.14 pershare any time before September 2, 2021; and (2) 63.9 million shares of IBM that cost us $10.9 billion.Counting IBM, we now have large ownership interests in four exceptional companies: 13.0% ofAmerican Express, 8.8% of Coca-Cola, 5.5% of IBM and 7.6% of Wells Fargo. (We also, of course,have many smaller, but important, positions.)We view these holdings as partnership interests in wonderful businesses, not as marketable securities tobe bought or sold based on their near-term prospects. Our share of theirearnings, however, are far from fully reflected inourearnings; only the dividends we receive from these businesses show up in ourfinancial reports. Over time, though, the undistributed earnings of these companies that are attributableto our ownership are of huge importance to us. That’s because they will be used in a variety of ways toincrease future earnings and dividends of the investee. They may also be devoted to stock repurchases,which will increase our share of the company’s future earnings.Had we owned our present positions throughout last year, our dividends from the “Big Four” wouldhave been $862 million. That’s all that would have been reported in Berkshire’s income statement. Ourshare of this quartet’s earnings, however, would have been far greater: $3.3 billion. Charlie and Ibelieve that the $2.4 billion that goes unreported on our books creates at least that amount of value forBerkshire as it fuels earnings gains in future years. We expect the combined earnings of the four – andtheir dividends as well – to increase in 2012 and, for that matter, almost every year for a long time tocome. A decade from now, our current holdings of the four companies might well account for earningsof $7 billion, of which $2 billion in dividends would come to us.I’ve run out of good news. Here are some developments that hurt us during 2011:• A few years back, I spent about $2 billion buying several bond issues of Energy Future Holdings, anelectric utility operation serving portions of Texas. That was a mistake – a bigmistake. In large measure, the company’s prospects were tied to the price of natural gas, which tanked shortly after our purchase andremains depressed. Though we have annually received interest payments of about $102 million since ourpurchase, the company’s ability to pay will soon be exhausted unless gas prices rise substantially. Wewrote down our investment by $1 billion in 2010 and by an additional $390 million last year.At yearend, we carried the bonds at their market value of $878 million. If gas prices remain at presentlevels, we will likely face a further loss, perhaps in an amount that will virtually wipe out our currentcarrying value. Conversely, a substantial increase in gas prices might allow us to recoup some, or evenall, of our write-down. However things turn out, I totally miscalculated the gain/loss probabilities whenI purchased the bonds. In tennis parlance, this was a major unforced error by your chairman.
4• Three large and very attractive fixed-income investments were called away from us by their issuers in2011. Swiss Re, Goldman Sachs and General Electric paid us an aggregate of $12.8 billion to redeemsecurities that were producing about $1.2 billion of pre-tax earnings for Berkshire. That’s a lot ofincome to replace, though our Lubrizol purchase did offset most of it.• Last year, I told you that “a housing recovery will probably begin within a year or so.” I was deadwrong. We have five businesses whose results are significantly influenced by housing activity. Theconnection is direct at Clayton Homes, which is the largest producer of homes in the country,accounting for about 7% of those constructed during 2011.Additionally, Acme Brick, Shaw (carpet), Johns Manville (insulation) and MiTek (building products,primarily connector plates used in roofing) are all materially affected by construction activity. Inaggregate, our five housing-related companies had pre-tax profits of $513 million in 2011. That’ssimilar to 2010 but down from $1.8 billion in 2006.Housing will come back – you can be sure of that. Over time, the number of housing units necessarilymatches the number of households (after allowing for a normal level of vacancies). For a period ofyears prior to 2008, however, America added more housing units than households. Inevitably, weended up with far too many units and the bubble popped with a violence that shook the entire economy.That created still another problem for housing: Early in a recession, household formations slow, and in2009 the decrease was dramatic.That devastating supply/demand equation is now reversed: Every day we are creating more householdsthan housing units. People may postpone hitching up during uncertain times, but eventually hormonestake over. And while “doubling-up” may be the initial reaction of some during a recession, living within-laws can quickly lose its allure.At our current annual pace of 600,000 housing starts – considerably less than the number of newhouseholds being formed – buyers and renters are sopping up what’s left of the old oversupply. (Thisprocess will run its course at different rates around the country; the supply-demand situation varieswidely by locale.) While this healing takes place, however, our housing-related companies sputter,employing only 43,315 people compared to 58,769 in 2006. This hugely important sector of theeconomy, which includes not only construction but everything that feeds off of it, remains in adepressionof its own. I believe this is the major reason a recovery in employment has so severelylagged the steady and substantial comeback we have seen in almost all other sectors of our economy.Wise monetary and fiscal policies play an important role in tempering recessions, but these tools don’tcreate households nor eliminate excess housing units. Fortunately, demographics and our marketsystem will restore the needed balance – probably before long. When that day comes, we will againbuild one million or more residential units annually. I believe pundits will be surprised at how farunemployment drops once that happens. They will then reawake to what has been true since 1776:America’s best days lie ahead.Intrinsic Business ValueCharlie and I measure our performance by the rate of gain in Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic businessvalue. If our gain over time outstrips the performance of the S&P 500, we have earned our paychecks. If itdoesn’t, we are overpaid at any price.We have no way to pinpoint intrinsic value. But we do have a useful, though considerably understated, proxy for it: per-share book value. This yardstick is meaningless at most companies. At Berkshire, however,book value very roughly tracks business values. That’s because the amount by which Berkshire’s intrinsic valueexceeds book value does not swing wildly from year to year, though it increases in most years. Over time, thedivergence will likely become ever more substantial in absolute terms, remaining reasonably steady, however, ona percentage basis as both the numerator and denominator of the business-value/book-value equation increase.5We’ve regularly emphasized that our book-value performance is almost certain to outpace the S&P 500in a bad year for the stock market and just as certainly will fall short in a strong up-year. The test is how we doover time. Last year’s annual report included a table laying out results for the 42 five-year periods since we tookover at Berkshire in 1965 (i.e., 1965-69, 1966-70, etc.). All showed our book value beating the S&P, and ourstring held for 2007-11. It will almost certainly snap, though, if the S&P 500 should put together a five-yearwinning streak (which it may well be on its way to doing as I write this).************I also included two tables last year that set forth the key quantitative ingredients that will help youestimate our per-share intrinsic value. I won’t repeat the full discussion here; you can find it reproduced onpages 99-100. To update the tables shown there, our per-share investments in 2011 increased 4% to $98,366, andour pre-tax earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments increased 18% to $6,990 per share.Charlie and I like to see gains in both areas, but our primary focus is on building operating earnings. Overtime, the businesses we currently own should increase their aggregate earnings, and we hope also to purchase somelarge operations that will give us a further boost. We now have eight subsidiaries that would each be included in theFortune 500 were they stand-alone companies. That leaves only 492 to go. My task is clear, and I’m on the prowl.Share Repurchases
Last September, we announced that Berkshire would repurchase its shares at a price of up to 110% of bookvalue. We were in the market for only a few days – buying $67 million of stock – before the price advanced beyondour limit. Nonetheless, the general importance of share repurchases suggests I should focus for a bit on the subject.
Charlie and I favor repurchases when two conditions are met: first, a company has ample funds to takecare of the operational and liquidity needs of its business; second, its stock is selling at a material discount to thecompany’s intrinsic business value, conservatively calculated.We have witnessed many bouts of repurchasing that failed our second test. Sometimes, of course,infractions – even serious ones – are innocent; many CEOs never stop believing their stock is cheap. In otherinstances, a less benign conclusion seems warranted. It doesn’t suffice to say that repurchases are being made tooffset the dilution from stock issuances or simply because a company has excess cash. Continuing shareholdersarehurtunless shares are purchased below intrinsic value. The first law of capital allocation – whether themoney is slated for acquisitions or share repurchases – is that what is smart at one price is dumb at another. (OneCEO who always stresses the price/value factor in repurchase decisions is Jamie Dimon at J.P. Morgan; Irecommend that you read his annual letter.)Charlie and I have mixed emotions when Berkshire shares sell well below intrinsic value. We likemaking money for continuing shareholders, and there is no surer way to do that than by buying an asset – ourown stock – that we know to be worthat leastx for less than that – for .9x, .8x or even lower. (As one of our directors says, it’s like shooting fish in a barrel, afterthe barrel has been drained and the fish have quit flopping.) Nevertheless, we don’t enjoy cashing out partners at a discount, even though our doing so may give the sellingshareholders a slightly higher price than they would receive if our bid was absent. When we are buying,therefore, we want those exiting partners to be fully informed about the value of the assets they are selling.At our limit price of 110% of book value, repurchases clearly increase Berkshire’s per-share intrinsicvalue. And the more and the cheaper we buy, the greater the gain for continuing shareholders. Therefore, if giventhe opportunity, we will likely repurchase stock aggressively at our price limit or lower. You should know,however, that we have no interest in supporting the stock and that our bids will fade in particularly weak markets.Nor will we buy shares if our cash-equivalent holdings are below $20 billion. At Berkshire, financial strengththat is unquestionable takes precedence over all else.************This discussion of repurchases offers me the chance to address the irrational reaction of many investorsto changes in stock prices. When Berkshire buys stock in a company that is repurchasing shares, we hope for twoevents: First, we have the normal hope that earnings of the business will increase at a good clip for a long time tocome; and second, we also hope that the stockunderperformsin the market for a long time as well. A corollary to this second point: “Talking our book” about a stock we own – were that to be effective – would actually beharmful to Berkshire, not helpful as commentators customarily assume. 6Let’s use IBM as an example. As all business observers know, CEOs Lou Gerstner and Sam Palmisanodid a superb job in moving IBM from near-bankruptcy twenty years ago to its prominence today. Theiroperational accomplishments were truly extraordinary.But their financial management was equally brilliant, particularly in recent years as the company’sfinancial flexibility improved. Indeed, I can think of no major company that has had better financial management, askill that has materially increased the gains enjoyed by IBM shareholders. The company has used debt wisely, madevalue-adding acquisitions almost exclusively for cash and aggressively repurchased its own stock.Today, IBM has 1.16 billion shares outstanding, of which we own about 63.9 million or 5.5%.Naturally, what happens to the company’s earnings over the next five years is of enormous importance to us.Beyond that, the company will likely spend $50 billion or so in those years to repurchase shares. Our quiz for theday: What should a long-term shareholder, such as Berkshire, cheer for during that period?
I won’t keep you in suspense. We should wish for IBM’s stock price to languishthroughout the five years.
Let’s do the math. If IBM’s stock price averages, say, $200 during the period, the company will acquire250 million shares for its $50 billion. There would consequently be 910 million shares outstanding, and wewould own about 7% of the company. If the stock conversely sells for an average of $300 during the five-yearperiod, IBM will acquire only 167 million shares. That would leave about 990 million shares outstanding afterfive years, of which we would own 6.5%.If IBM were to earn, say, $20 billion in the fifth year, our share of those earnings would be a full $100million greater under the “disappointing” scenario of a lower stock price than they would have been at the higherprice. At some later point our shares would be worth perhaps $1
1⁄2billion more than if the “high-price” repurchase scenario had taken place.
The logic is simple: If you are going to be a net buyer of stocks in the future, either directly with your ownmoney or indirectly (through your ownership of a company that is repurchasing shares), you are hurtwhen stocks rise. You benefit when stocks swoon.Emotions, however, too often complicate the matter: Most people, includingthose who will be net buyers in the future, take comfort in seeing stock prices advance. These shareholders resemblea commuter who rejoices after the price of gas increases, simply because his tank contains a day’s supply.
Charlie and I don’t expect to win many of you over to our way of thinking – we’ve observed enoughhuman behavior to know the futility of that – but we do want you to be aware of our personal calculus. And herea confession is in order: In my early days I, too, rejoiced when the market rose. Then I read Chapter Eight of BenGraham’sThe Intelligent Investor, the chapter dealing with how investors should view fluctuations in stockprices. Immediately the scales fell from my eyes, and low prices became my friend. Picking up that book was oneof the luckiest moments in my life.In the end, the success of our IBM investment will be determined primarily by its future earnings. Butan important secondary factor will be how many shares the company purchases with the substantial sums it islikely to devote to this activity. And if repurchases ever reduce the IBM shares outstanding to 63.9 million, I willabandon my famed frugality and give Berkshire employees a paid holiday.************Now, let’s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheetand income characteristics from the others. Lumping them together therefore impedes analysis. So we’ll presentthem as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them. Because we may be repurchasingBerkshire shares from some of you, we will offer our thoughts in each section as to how intrinsic value comparesto carrying value.
7InsuranceLet’s look first at insurance, Berkshire’s core operation and the engine that has propelled our expansionover the years.Property-casualty (“P/C”) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases,such as those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. Thiscollect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go toothers. Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire’s benefit. Though individual policies and claimscome and go, the amount of float we hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume.Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how we have grown, as the following table shows:Year
Float (in $ millions)
1970 $ 391980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322011 70,571It’s unlikely that our float will grow much – if at all – from its current level. That’s mainly because wealready have an outsized amount relative to our premium volume. Were there to be a declinein float, I will add, it would almost certainly beverygradual and therefore impose no unusual demand for funds on us.If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profitthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit occurs, we enjoy the use of freemoney – and, better yet, getpaidfor holding it. Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happyresult creates intense competition, so vigorous in most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole tooperate at a significant underwritingloss. For example, State Farm, by far the country’s largest insurer and a well-managedcompany besides, has incurred an underwriting loss in eight of the last eleven years. There area lot of ways to lose money in insurance, and the industry is resourceful in creating new ones.As noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for nineconsecutive years, our gain for the period having totaled $17 billion. I believe it likely that we will continue tounderwrite profitably in most – though certainly not all – future years. If we accomplish that, our float will bebetter than cost-free. We will profit just as we would if some party deposited $70.6 billion with us, paid us a feefor holding its money and then let us invest its funds for our own benefit.So how does this attractive float affect intrinsic value calculations? Our float is deducted in fullas a liability in calculating Berkshire’s book value, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and were unable toreplenish it. But that’s an incorrect way to view float, which should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Iffloat is both costless and long-enduring, the true value of this liability is farlower than the accounting liability. Partially offsetting this overstated liability is $15.5 billion of “goodwill” attributable to our insurancecompanies that is included in book value as an asset. In effect, this goodwill represents the price we paid for thefloat-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing on its true value. If an insurance business produces large and sustained underwriting losses, any goodwill assetattributable to it should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.Fortunately, that’s not the case at Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of ourinsurance goodwill – whatwewould pay to purchase floatof similar quality– to be far in excess of its historic carrying value. The value of our float is one reason – a huge reason – why we believe Berkshire’s intrinsicbusiness value substantially exceeds book value.Let me emphasize once again that cost-free float is notan outcome to be expected for the P/C industry as a whole: We don’t think there is much “Berkshire-quality” float existing in the insurance world. In most years,including 2011, the industry’s premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the 8industry’s overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized byAmerican industry, a sorry performance almost certain to continue. Berkshire’s outstanding economics exist onlybecause we have some terrific managers running some extraordinary insurance operations. Let me tell you aboutthe major units.************First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, run by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risksthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,most importantly, brains in a manner that is unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire torisks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are farmore conservative in that respect than most large insurers. For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from somemega-catastrophe – a loss about triple anything it has ever faced – Berkshire as a whole would likely record amoderate profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings. Concurrently, all other major insurers andreinsurers would be far in the red, and some would face insolvency.From a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $34 billion andsignificant underwriting profits, a feat that no CEO of any other insurer has come close to matching. By theseaccomplishments, he has added a great many billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire. Charlie would gladlytrade me for a second Ajit. Alas, there is none.************We have another insurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all exposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively evaluate the likelihood of any exposureactually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that will deliver a profit, on average,after both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if theappropriate premium can’t be obtained.Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can’t turn their back on businessthat their competitors are eagerly writing. That old line, “The other guy is doing it so we must as well,” spellstrouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance. Indeed, a good underwriter needs an independentmindset akin to that of the senior citizen who received a call from his wife while driving home. “Albert, be careful,”she warned, “I just heard on the radio that there’s a car going the wrong way down the Interstate.” “Mabel, theydon’t know the half of it,” replied Albert, “It’s not just one car, there are hundreds of them.”Tad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re’shuge float has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, it will continue tobe. In the first few years after we acquired it, General Re was a major headache. Now it’s a treasure.************Finally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 61 years ago. GEICO is run by TonyNicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 50 years of service in 2011.GEICO’s much-envied record comes from Tony’s brilliant execution of a superb and almost-impossible-to-replicate business model. During Tony’s 18-year tenure as CEO, our market share has grown from 2.0%to 9.3%. If it had instead remained static – as it had for more than a decade before he took over – our premium volumewould now be $3.3 billion rather than the $15.4 billion we attained in 2011. The extra value created by Tony and hisassociates is a major element in Berkshire’s excess of intrinsic value over book value.There is still more than 90% of the auto-insurance market left for GEICO to rake in. Don’t bet againstTony acquiring chunks of it year after year in the future. Our low costs permit low prices, and every day moreAmericans discover that the Gecko is doing them a favor when he urges them to visit GEICO.com for a quote.(Our lizard has another endearing quality: Unlike human spokesmen or spokeswomen who expensively representother insurance companies, our little fellow has no agent.)************In addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies, most ofthem plying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world. In aggregate, their results have consistently beenprofitable and the float they provide us is substantial. Charlie and I treasure these companies and their managers. 9At yearend, we acquired Princeton Insurance, a New Jersey writer of medical malpractice policies. Thisbolt-on transaction expands the managerial domain of Tim Kenesey, the star CEO of Medical Protective, ourIndiana-based med-mal insurer. Princeton brings with it more than $600 million of float, an amount that isincluded in the following table.Here is the record of all four segments of our property-casualty and life insurance businesses:Underwriting Profit

Among large insurance operations, Berkshire’s impresses me as the best in the world.Regulated, Capital-Intensive BusinessesWe have two very large businesses, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, that have important commoncharacteristics distinguishing them from our many other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own sectorin this letter and also split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.A key characteristic of both companies is the huge investment they have in very long-lived, regulatedassets, with these partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is not needed: Both businesses have earning power that even under terrible business conditions amplycovers their interest requirements. In a less than robust economy during 2011, for example, BNSF’s interestcoverage was 9.5x. At MidAmerican, meanwhile, two key factors ensure its ability to service debt under allcircumstances: The stability of earnings that is inherent in our exclusively offering an essential service and adiversity of earnings streams, which shield it from the actions of any single regulatory body.Measured by ton-miles, rail moves 42% of America’s inter-city freight, and BNSF moves more thanany other railroad – about 37% of the industry total. A little math will tell you that about 15% of allinter-city ton-miles of freight in the U.S. is transported by BNSF. It is no exaggeration to characterize railroads as thecirculatory system of our economy. Your railroad is the largest artery.All of this places a huge responsibility on us. We must, without fail, maintain and improve our 23,000miles of track along with 13,000 bridges, 80 tunnels, 6,900 locomotives and 78,600 freight cars. This job requiresus to have ample financial resources underalleconomic scenarios and to have the human talent that can instantlyand effectively deal with the vicissitudes of nature, such as the widespread flooding BNSF labored under lastsummer.To fulfill its societal obligation, BNSF regularly invests far more than its depreciation charge, with theexcess amounting to $1.8 billion in 2011. The three other major U.S. railroads are making similar outlays.Though many people decry our country’s inadequate infrastructure spending, that criticism cannot be leviedagainst the railroad industry. It is pouring money – funds from the private sector– into the investment projects needed to provide better and more extensive service in the future. If railroads were not making these hugeexpenditures, our country’s publicly-financed highway system would face even greater congestion andmaintenance problems than exist today.Massive investments of the sort that BNSF is making would be foolish if it could not earn appropriatereturns on the incremental sums it commits. But I am confident it will do so because of the value it delivers.Many years ago Ben Franklin counseled, “Keep thy shop, and thy shop will keep thee.” Translating this to ourregulated businesses, he might today say, “Take care of your customer, and the regulator – your customer’srepresentative – will take care of you.” Good behavior by each party begets good behavior in return. 10At MidAmerican, we participate in a similar “social compact.” We are expected to put up ever-increasingsums to satisfy the future needs of our customers. If we meanwhile operate reliably and efficiently,we know that we will obtain a fair return on these investments.MidAmerican, 89.8% owned by Berkshire, supplies 2.5 million customers in the U.S. with electricity,operating as the largest supplier in Iowa, Utah and Wyoming and as an important provider in six other states aswell. Our pipelines transport 8% of the country’s natural gas. Obviously, many millions of Americans depend onus every day. They haven’t been disappointed.When MidAmerican purchased Northern Natural Gas pipeline in 2002, that company’s performance asa pipeline was rated dead last, 43 out of 43, by the leading authority in the field. In the most recent report,Northern Natural was ranked second. The top spot was held by our other pipeline, Kern River.In its electric business, MidAmerican has a comparable record. In the most recent survey of customersatisfaction, MidAmerican’s U.S. utilities ranked second among 60 utility groups surveyed. The story was fardifferent not many years back when MidAmerican acquired these properties.MidAmerican will have 3,316 megawatts of wind generation in operation by the end of 2012, far morethan any other regulated electric utility in the country. The total amount that we have invested or committed towind is a staggering $6 billion. We can make this sort of investment because MidAmerican retains allof its earnings, unlike other utilities that generally pay out most of what they earn. In addition, late last year we took ontwo solar projects – one 100%-owned in California and the other 49%-owned in Arizona – that will cost about $3billion to construct. Many more wind and solar projects will almost certainly follow.As you can tell by now, I am proud of what has been accomplished for our society by Matt Rose atBNSF and by Greg Abel at MidAmerican. I am also both proud and grateful for what they have accomplished forBerkshire shareholders. Below are the relevant figures:MidAmerican

*Does not include purchase-accounting adjustments.**Includes earnings of Lubrizol from September 16.This group of companies sells products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of the businessesenjoy terrific economics, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangibleassets that run from 25% after-tax to more than 100%. Others produce good returns in the area of 12-20%. A few, however, have very poor returns, aresult of some serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation. These errors came about because I misjudgedeither the competitive strength of the business being purchased or the future economics of the industry in which itoperated. I try to look out ten or twenty years when making an acquisition, but sometimes my eyesight has beenpoor. Charlie’s has been better; he voted no more than “present” on several of my errant purchases.Berkshire’s newer shareholders may be puzzled over our decision to hold on to my mistakes. After all,their earnings can never be consequential to Berkshire’s valuation, and problem companies require moremanagerial time than winners. Any management consultant or Wall Street advisor would look at our laggards andsay “dump them.”That won’t happen. For 29 years, we have regularly laid out Berkshire’s economic principles in thesereports (pages 93-98) and Number 11 describes our general reluctance to sell poor performers (which, in mostcases, lag because of industry factors rather than managerial shortcomings). Our approach is far from Darwinian,and many of you may disapprove of it. I can understand your position. However, we have made – and continue tomake – a commitment to the sellers of businesses we buy that we will retain those businesses through thick andthin. So far, the dollar cost of that commitment has not been substantial and may well be offset by the goodwill itbuilds among prospective sellers looking for the right permanent home for their treasured business and loyalassociates. These owners know that what they get with us can’t be delivered by others and that our commitmentswill be good for many decades to come.12Please understand, however, that Charlie and I are neither masochists nor Pollyannas. If either of thefailings we set forth in Rule 11 is present – if the business will likely be a cash drain over the longer term, or if laborstrife is endemic – we will take prompt and decisive action. Such a situation has happened only a couple of times inour 47-year history, and none of the businesses we now own is in straits requiring us to consider disposing of it.************The steady and substantial comeback in the U.S. economy since mid-2009 is clear from the earningsshown at the front of this section. This compilation includes 54 of our companies. But one of these, Marmon, isitself the owner of 140 operations in eleven distinct business sectors. In short, when you look at Berkshire, youare looking across corporate America. So let’s dig a little deeper to gain a greater insight into what has happenedin the last few years.The four housing-related companies in this section (a group that excludes Clayton, which is carriedunder Finance and Financial Products) had aggregate pre-tax earnings of $227 million in 2009, $362 million in2010 and $359 million in 2011. If you subtract these earnings from those in the combined statement, you will seethat our multiple and diversenon-housingoperations earned $1,831 million in 2009, $3,912 million in 2010 and$4,678 million in 2011. About $291 million of the 2011 earnings came from the Lubrizol acquisition. The profileof the remaining 2011 earnings – $4,387 million – illustrates the comeback of much of America from thedevastation wrought by the 2008 financial panic. Though housing-related businesses remain in the emergencyroom, most other businesses have left the hospital with their health fully restored.************
Almost all of our managers delivered outstanding performances last year, among them those managerswho run housing-related businesses and were therefore fighting hurricane-force headwinds. Here are a few examples:
• Vic Mancinelli again set a record at CTB, our agricultural equipment operation. We purchased CTB in2002 for $139 million. It has subsequently distributed $180 million to Berkshire, last year earned $124million pre-tax and has $109 million in cash. Vic has made a number of bolt-on acquisitions over theyears, including a meaningful one he signed up after yearend.• TTI, our electric components distributor, increased its sales to a record $2.1 billion, up 12.4% from2010. Earnings also hit a record, up 127% from 2007, the year in which we purchased the business. In2011, TTI performed far better than the large publicly-traded companies in its field. That’s no surprise:Paul Andrews and his associates have been besting them for years. Charlie and I are delighted that Paulnegotiated a large bolt-on acquisition early in 2012. We hope more follow.• Iscar, our 80%-owned cutting-tools operation, continues to amaze us. Its sales growth and overallperformance are unique in its industry. Iscar’s managers – Eitan Wertheimer, Jacob Harpaz and DannyGoldman – are brilliant strategists and operators. When the economic world was cratering in November2008, they stepped up to buy Tungaloy, a leading Japanese cutting-tool manufacturer. Tungaloysuffered significant damage when the tsunami hit north of Tokyo last spring. But you wouldn’t knowthat now: Tungaloy went on to set a sales record in 2011. I visited the Iwaki plant in November andwas inspired by the dedication and enthusiasm of Tungaloy’s management, as well as its staff. They area wonderful group and deserve your admiration and thanks.• McLane, our huge distribution company that is run by Grady Rosier, added important new customers in2011 and set a pre-tax earnings record of $370 million. Since its purchase in 2003 for $1.5 billion, thecompany has had pre-tax earnings of $2.4 billion and also increased its LIFO reserve by $230 millionbecause the prices of the retail products it distributes (candy, gum, cigarettes, etc.) have risen. Gradyruns a logistical machine second to none. You can look for bolt-ons at McLane, particularly in our newwine-and-spirits distribution business.
13• Jordan Hansell took over at NetJets in April and delivered 2011 pre-tax earnings of $227 million. Thatis a particularly impressive performance because the sale of new planes was slow during most of theyear. In December, however, there was an uptick that was more than seasonally normal. Howpermanent it will be is uncertain.A few years ago NetJets was my number one worry: Its costs were far out of line with revenues, andcash was hemorrhaging. Without Berkshire’s support, NetJets would have gone broke. These problemsare behind us, and Jordan is now delivering steady profits from a well-controlled and smoothly-runningoperation. NetJets is proceeding on a plan to enter China with some first-class partners, a move thatwill widen our business “moat.” No other fractional-ownership operator has remotely the size andbreadth of the NetJets operation, and none ever will. NetJets’ unrelenting focus on safety and servicehas paid off in the marketplace.• It’s a joy to watch Marmon’s progress under Frank Ptak’s leadership. In addition to achieving internalgrowth, Frank regularly makes bolt-on acquisitions that, in aggregate, will materially increase Marmon’searning power. (He did three, costing about $270 million, in the last few months.) Joint ventures aroundthe world are another opportunity for Marmon. At midyear Marmon partnered with the Kundalia familyin an Indian crane operation that is already delivering substantial profits. This is Marmon’s secondventure with the family, following a successful wire and cable partnership instituted a few years ago.Of the eleven major sectors in which Marmon operates, ten delivered gains in earnings last year. Youcan be confident of higher earnings from Marmon in the years ahead.• “Buy commodities, sell brands” has long been a formula for business success. It has producedenormous and sustained profits for Coca-Cola since 1886 and Wrigley since 1891. On a smaller scale,we have enjoyed good fortune with this approach at See’s Candy since we purchased it 40 years ago.Last year See’s had record pre-tax earnings of $83 million, bringing its total since we bought it to $1.65billion. Contrast that figure with our purchase price of $25 million and our yearend carrying-value (netof cash) of less than zero. (Yes, you read that right; capital employed at See’s fluctuates seasonally,hitting a low after Christmas.) Credit Brad Kinstler for taking the company to new heights since hebecame CEO in 2006.• Nebraska Furniture Mart (80% owned) set an earnings record in 2011, netting more than ten times whatit did in 1983, when we acquired our stake.But that’s not the big news. More important was NFM’s acquisition of a 433-acre tract north of Dallason which we will build what is almost certain to be the highest-volume home-furnishings store in thecountry. Currently, that title is shared by our two stores in Omaha and Kansas City, each of which hadrecord-setting sales of more than $400 million in 2011. It will be several years before the Texas store iscompleted, but I look forward to cutting the ribbon at the opening. (At Berkshire, the managers do thework; I take the bows.)Our new store, which will offer an unequalled variety of merchandise sold at prices that can’t bematched, will bring huge crowds from near and far. This drawing power and our extensive holdings ofland at the site should enable us to attract a number of other major stores. (If any high-volume retailersare reading this, contact me.)Our experience with NFM and the Blumkin family that runs it has been a real joy. The business wasbuilt by Rose Blumkin (known to all as “Mrs. B”), who started the company in 1937 with $500 and adream. She sold me our interest when she was 89 and worked until she was 103. (After retiring, shedied the next year, a sequence I point out to any other Berkshire manager who even thinks of retiring.)Mrs. B’s son, Louie, now 92, helped his mother build the business after he returned from World War IIand, along with his wife, Fran, has been my friend for 55 years. In turn, Louie’s sons, Ron and Irv, havetaken the company to new heights, first opening the Kansas City store and now gearing up for Texas.14The “boys” and I have had many great times together, and I count them among my best friends. TheBlumkins are a remarkable family. Never inclined to let an extraordinary gene pool go to waste, I amrejoicing these days because several members of the fourth Blumkin generation have joined NFM.Overall, the intrinsic value of the businesses in this Berkshire sector significantly exceeds their bookvalue. For many of the smaller companies, however, this is not true. I have made more than my share of mistakesbuying small companies. Charlie long ago told me, “If something’s not worth doing at all, it’s not worthdoing well,” and I should have listened harder. In any event, our large purchases have generally workedwell – extraordinarily well in a few cases – and overall this sector is a winner for us.************Certain shareholders have told me they hunger for more discussions of accounting arcana. So here’s abit of GAAP-mandated nonsense I hope both of them enjoy.Common sense would tell you that our varied subsidiaries should be carried on our books at their costplus the earnings they have retained since our purchase (unless their economic value has materially decreased, inwhich case an appropriate write-down must be taken). And that’s essentially the reality at Berkshire – except forthe weird situation at Marmon.We purchased 64% of the company in 2008 and put this interest on our books at our cost, $4.8 billion.So far, so good. Then, in early 2011, pursuant to our original contract with the Pritzker family, we purchased anadditional 16%, paying $1.5 billion as called for by a formula that reflected Marmon’s increased value. In thisinstance, however, we were required to immediately write off $614 million of the purchase price retroactive tothe end of 2010. (Don’t ask!) Obviously, this write-off had no connection to economic reality. The excess ofMarmon’s intrinsic value over its carrying value is widened by this meaningless write-down.Finance and Financial ProductsThis sector, our smallest, includes two rental companies, XTRA (trailers) and CORT (furniture), andClayton Homes, the country’s leading producer and financer of manufactured homes. Aside from these 100%-ownedsubsidiaries, we also include in this category a collection of financial assets and our 50% interest in BerkadiaCommercial Mortgage.It’s instructive to look at what transpired at our three operating businesses after the economy fell off acliff in late 2008, because their experiences illuminate the fractured recovery that later came along.Results at our two leasing companies mirrored the “non-housing” economy. Their combined pre-taxearnings were $13 million in 2009, $53 million in 2010 and $155 million in 2011, an improvement reflecting thesteady recovery we have seen in almost all of our non-housing businesses. In contrast, Clayton’s world ofmanufactured housing (just like site-built housing) has endured a veritable depression, experiencing no recoveryto date. Manufactured housing sales in the nation were 49,789 homes in 2009, 50,046 in 2010 and 51,606 in2011. (When housing was booming in 2005, they were 146,744.)Despite these difficult times, Clayton has continued to operate profitably, largely because its mortgageportfolio has performed well under trying circumstances. Because we are the largest lender in the manufacturedhomes sector and are also normally lending to lower-and-middle-income families, you might expect us to sufferheavy losses during a housing meltdown. But by sticking to old-fashioned loan policies – meaningful downpayments and monthly payments with a sensible relationship to regular income – Clayton has kept losses toacceptable levels. It has done so even though many of our borrowers have had negative equity for some time.As is well-known, the U.S. went off the rails in its home-ownership and mortgage-lending policies,and for these mistakes our economy is now paying a huge price. All of us participated in the destructivebehavior – government, lenders, borrowers, the media, rating agencies, you name it. At the core of the folly wasthe almost universal belief that the value of houses was certain to increase over time and that any dipswould be inconsequential. The acceptance of this premise justified almost any price and practice in housingtransactions. Homeowners everywhere felt richer and rushed to “monetize” the increased value of their homes byrefinancings. These massive cash infusions fueled a consumption binge throughout our economy. It all seemedgreat fun while it lasted. (A largely unnoted fact: Large numbers of people who have “lost” their house throughforeclosure have actually realized a profit because they carried out refinancings earlier that gave them cash inexcess of their cost. In these cases, the evicted homeowner was the winner, and the victim was the lender.) 15In 2007, the bubble burst, just as all bubbles must. We are now in the fourth year of a cure that, thoughlong and painful, is sure to succeed. Today, household formations are consistently exceeding housing starts.Clayton’s earnings should improve materially when the nation’s excess housing inventory is workedoff. As I see things today, however, I believe the intrinsic value of the three businesses in this sector does notdiffer materially from their book value.Investments

*This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP “cost” differs in a few cases because ofwrite-ups or write-downs that have been required.We made few changes in our investment holdings during 2011. But three moves were important: ourpurchases of IBM and Bank of America and the $1 billion addition we made to our Wells Fargo position.The banking industry is back on its feet, and Wells Fargo is prospering. Its earnings are strong, itsassets solid and its capital at record levels. At Bank of America, some huge mistakes were made by priormanagement. Brian Moynihan has made excellent progress in cleaning these up, though the completion of thatprocess will take a number of years. Concurrently, he is nurturing a huge and attractive underlying business thatwill endure long after today’s problems are forgotten. Our warrants to buy 700 million Bank of America shareswill likely be of great value before they expire.As was the case with Coca-Cola in 1988 and the railroads in 2006, I was late to the IBM party. I havebeen reading the company’s annual report for more than 50 years, but it wasn’t until a Saturday in March lastyear that my thinking crystallized. As Thoreau said, “It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.”Todd Combs built a $1.75 billion portfolio (at cost) last year, and Ted Weschler will soon create one ofsimilar size. Each of them receives 80% of his performance compensation from his own results and 20% from hispartner’s. When our quarterly filings report relatively small holdings, these are not likely to be buys I made(though the media often overlook that point) but rather holdings denoting purchases by Todd or Ted.16One additional point about these two new arrivals. Both Ted and Todd will be helpful to the next CEOof Berkshire in making acquisitions. They have excellent “business minds” that grasp the economic forces likelyto determine the future of a wide variety of businesses. They are aided in their thinking by an understanding ofwhat is predictable and what is unknowable.************There is little new to report on our derivatives positions, which we have described in detail in past reports.(Annual reports since 1977 are available at www.berkshirehathaway.com.) One important industry change,however, must be noted: Though our existing contracts have very minor collateral requirements, the rules havechanged for new positions. Consequently, we will not be initiating any major derivatives positions. We shuncontracts of any type that could require the instant posting of collateral. The possibility of some sudden and hugeposting requirement – arising from an out-of-the-blue event such as a worldwide financial panic or massive terroristattack – is inconsistent with our primary objectives of redundant liquidity and unquestioned financial strength.Our insurance-like derivatives contracts, whereby we pay if various issues included in high-yield bondindices default, are coming to a close. The contracts that most exposed us to losses have already expired, and theremainder will terminate soon. In 2011, we paid out $86 million on two losses, bringing our total payments to$2.6 billion. We are almost certain to realize a final “underwriting profit” on this portfolio because the premiumswe received were $3.4 billion, and our future losses are apt to be minor. In addition, we will have averaged about$2 billion of float over the five-year life of these contracts. This successful result during a time of great creditstress underscores the importance of obtaining a premium that is commensurate with the risk.
Charlie and I continue to believe that our equity-put positions will produce a significant profit, consideringboth the $4.2 billion of float we will have held for more than fifteen years and the $222 million profit we’ve alreadyrealized on contracts that we repurchased. At yearend, Berkshire’s book value reflected a liability of $8.5 billion forthe remaining contracts; if they had all come due at that time our payment would have been $6.2 billion.
The Basic Choices for Investors and the One We Strongly PreferInvesting is often described as the process of laying out money now in the expectation of receivingmore money in the future. At Berkshire we take a more demanding approach, defining investing as the transfer toothers of purchasing power now with the reasoned expectation of receiving more purchasing power – after taxes have been paid on nominal gains– in the future. More succinctly, investing is forgoing consumption now inorder to have the ability to consume more at a later date.From our definition there flows an important corollary: The riskiness of an investment is notmeasured by beta (a Wall Street term encompassing volatility and often used in measuring risk) but rather by theprobability – thereasonedprobability – of that investment causing its owner a loss of purchasing-power over hiscontemplated holding period. Assets can fluctuate greatly in price and not be risky as long as they are reasonablycertain to deliver increased purchasing power over their holding period. And as we will see, a non-fluctuatingasset can be laden with risk.Investment possibilities are both many and varied. There are three major categories, however, and it’simportant to understand the characteristics of each. So let’s survey the field.• Investments that are denominated in a given currency include money-market funds, bonds, mortgages,bank deposits, and other instruments. Most of these currency-based investments are thought of as “safe.”In truth they are among the most dangerous of assets. Their beta may be zero, but their risk is huge.Over the past century these instruments have destroyed the purchasing power of investors in manycountries, even as the holders continued to receive timely payments of interest and principal. This uglyresult, moreover, will forever recur. Governments determine the ultimate value of money, and systemicforces will sometimes cause them to gravitate to policies that produce inflation. From time to time suchpolicies spin out of control.Even in the U.S., where the wish for a stable currency is strong, the dollar has fallen a staggering 86%in value since 1965, when I took over management of Berkshire. It takes no less than $7 today to buywhat $1 did at that time. Consequently, a tax-free institution would have needed 4.3% interest annuallyfrom bond investments over that period to simply maintain its purchasing power. Its managers wouldhave been kidding themselves if they thought of anyportion of that interest as “income.”17For tax-paying investors like you and me, the picture has been far worse. During the same 47-yearperiod, continuous rolling of U.S. Treasury bills produced 5.7% annually. That sounds satisfactory. Butif an individual investor paid personal income taxes at a rate averaging 25%, this 5.7% return wouldhave yieldednothingin the way of real income. This investor’s visible income tax would have strippedhim of 1.4 points of the stated yield, and the invisible inflation tax would have devoured the remaining4.3 points. It’s noteworthy that the implicit inflation “tax” was more than triple the explicit income taxthat our investor probably thought of as his main burden. “In God We Trust” may be imprinted on ourcurrency, but the hand that activates our government’s printing press has been all too human.High interest rates, of course, can compensate purchasers for the inflation risk they face with currency-basedinvestments – and indeed, rates in the early 1980s did that job nicely. Current rates, however, do not comeclose to offsetting the purchasing-power risk that investors assume. Right now bonds should come with awarning label.Under today’s conditions, therefore, I do not like currency-based investments. Even so, Berkshire holdssignificant amounts of them, primarily of the short-term variety. At Berkshire the need for ampleliquidity occupies center stage and willneverbe slighted, however inadequate rates may be. Accommodating this need, we primarily hold U.S. Treasury bills, the only investment that can becounted on for liquidity under the most chaotic of economic conditions. Our working level for liquidityis $20 billion; $10 billion is our absolute minimum.Beyond the requirements that liquidity and regulators impose on us, we will purchase currency-relatedsecurities only if they offer the possibility of unusual gain – either because a particular credit ismispriced, as can occur in periodic junk-bond debacles, or because rates rise to a level that offers thepossibility of realizing substantial capital gains on high-grade bonds when rates fall. Though we’veexploited both opportunities in the past – and may do so again – we are now 180 degrees removed fromsuch prospects. Today, a wry comment that Wall Streeter Shelby Cullom Davis made long ago seemsapt: “Bonds promoted as offering risk-free returns are now priced to deliver return-free risk.”• The second major category of investments involves assets that will never produce anything, but that arepurchased in the buyer’s hope that someone else – who also knows that the assets will be foreverunproductive – will pay more for them in the future. Tulips, of all things, briefly became a favorite ofsuch buyers in the 17
thcentury.This type of investment requires an expanding pool of buyers, who, in turn, are enticed because theybelieve the buying pool will expand still further. Owners are notinspired by what the asset itself can produce – it will remain lifeless forever – but rather by the belief that others will desire it even moreavidly in the future.The major asset in this category is gold, currently a huge favorite of investors who fear almost all otherassets, especially paper money (of whose value, as noted, they are right to be fearful). Gold, however,has two significant shortcomings, being neither of much use nor procreative. True, gold has someindustrial and decorative utility, but the demand for these purposes is both limited and incapable ofsoaking up new production. Meanwhile, if you own one ounce of gold for an eternity, you will stillown one ounce at its end.What motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow. During thepast decade that belief has proved correct. Beyond that, the rising price has on its own generatedadditional buying enthusiasm, attracting purchasers who see the rise as validating an investment thesis.As “bandwagon” investors join any party, they create their own truth – for a while. Over the past 15 years, both Internet stocks and houses have demonstrated the extraordinary excessesthat can be created by combining an initially sensible thesis with well-publicized rising prices. In thesebubbles, an army of originally skeptical investors succumbed to the “proof” delivered by the market,and the pool of buyers – for a time – expanded sufficiently to keep the bandwagon rolling. But bubblesblown large enough inevitably pop. And then the old proverb is confirmed once again: “What the wiseman does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.”18Today the world’s gold stock is about 170,000 metric tons. If all of this gold were melded together, itwould form a cube of about 68 feet per side. (Picture it fitting comfortably within a baseball infield.) At$1,750 per ounce – gold’s price as I write this – its value would be $9.6 trillion. Call this cube pile A.Let’s now create a pile B costing an equal amount. For that, we could buy allU.S. cropland (400 million acres with output of about $200 billion annually), plus 16 Exxon Mobils (the world’s mostprofitable company, one earning more than $40 billion annually). After these purchases, we wouldhave about $1 trillion left over for walking-around money (no sense feeling strapped after this buyingbinge). Can you imagine an investor with $9.6 trillion selecting pile A over pile B?Beyond the staggering valuation given the existing stock of gold, current prices make today’s annualproduction of gold command about $160 billion. Buyers – whether jewelry and industrial users,frightened individuals, or speculators – must continually absorb this additional supply to merelymaintain an equilibrium at present prices.A century from now the 400 million acres of farmland will have produced staggering amounts of corn,wheat, cotton, and other crops – and will continue to produce that valuable bounty, whatever thecurrency may be. Exxon Mobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to itsowners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions (and, remember, you get 16Exxons). The 170,000 tons of gold will be unchanged in size and still incapable of producing anything. You canfondle the cube, but it will not respond.Admittedly, when people a century from now are fearful, it’s likely many will still rush to gold. I’mconfident, however, that the $9.6 trillion current valuation of pile A will compound over the century ata rate far inferior to that achieved by pile B.• Our first two categories enjoy maximum popularity at peaks of fear: Terror over economic collapsedrives individuals to currency-based assets, most particularly U.S. obligations, and fear of currencycollapse fosters movement to sterile assets such as gold. We heard “cash is king” in late 2008, justwhen cash should have been deployed rather than held. Similarly, we heard “cash is trash” in the early1980s just when fixed-dollar investments were at their most attractive level in memory. On thoseoccasions, investors who required a supportive crowd paid dearly for that comfort.My own preference – and you knew this was coming – is our third category: investment in productiveassets, whether businesses, farms, or real estate. Ideally, these assets should have the ability ininflationary times to deliver output that will retain its purchasing-power value while requiring aminimum of new capital investment. Farms, real estate, and many businesses such as Coca-Cola, IBMand our own See’s Candy meet that double-barreled test. Certain other companies – think of ourregulated utilities, for example – fail it because inflation places heavy capital requirements on them. Toearn more, their owners must invest more. Even so, these investments will remain superior tononproductive or currency-based assets.Whether the currency a century from now is based on gold, seashells, shark teeth, or a piece of paper(as today), people will be willing to exchange a couple of minutes of their daily labor for a Coca-Colaor some See’s peanut brittle. In the future the U.S. population will move more goods, consume morefood, and require more living space than it does now. People will forever exchange what they producefor what others produce.Our country’s businesses will continue to efficiently deliver goods and services wanted by our citizens.Metaphorically, these commercial “cows” will live for centuries and give ever greater quantities of “milk”to boot. Their value will be determined not by the medium of exchange but rather by their capacity todeliver milk. Proceeds from the sale of the milk will compound for the owners of the cows, just as theydid during the 20
thcentury when the Dow increased from 66 to 11,497 (and paid loads of dividends aswell). Berkshire’s goal will be to increase its ownership of first-class businesses. Our first choice will beto own them in their entirety – but we will also be owners by way of holding sizable amounts ofmarketable stocks. I believe that over any extended period of time this category of investing will prove tobe the runaway winner among the three we’ve examined. More important, it will be by farthe safest.19The Annual MeetingThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 5
that the CenturyLink Center (renamed from “Qwest”). Last year, Carrie Kizer debuted as the ringmaster and earned a lifetime assignment. Everyone lovedthe job she did – especially me.Soon after the 7 a.m. opening of the doors, we will have a new activity: The Newspaper Tossing Challenge.Late last year, Berkshire purchased the Omaha World-Herald and, in my meeting with its shareholder-employees,I told of the folding and throwing skills I developed while delivering 500,000 papers as a teenager.I immediately saw skepticism in the eyes of the audience. That was no surprise to me. After all, thereporters’ mantra is: “If your mother says she loves you, check it out.” So now I have to back up my claim. Atthe meeting, I will take on all comers in making 35-foot tosses of the World-Herald to a Clayton porch. Anychallenger whose paper lands closer to the doorstep than mine will receive a dilly bar. I’ve asked Dairy Queen tosupply several for the contest, though I doubt that any will be needed. We will have a large stack of papers. Grabone. Fold it (no rubber bands). Take your best shot. Make my day.At 8:30, a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answerperiod, which (with a break for lunch at the CenturyLink’s stands) will last until 3:30. After a short recess,Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decide to leave during the day’s question periods,please do so whileCharlieis talking.The best reason to exit, of course, is toshop. We will help you do so by filling the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you did yourpart, and most locations racked up record sales. In a nine-hour period, we sold 1,249 pairs of Justin boots, 11,254pounds of See’s candy, 8,000 Quikut knives (that’s 15 knives per minute) and 6,126 pairs of Wells Lamontgloves, a Marmon product whose very existence was news to me. (The product I focus on is money.) But you cando better. Remember: Anyone who says money can’t buy happiness simply hasn’t shopped at our meeting.Among the new exhibitors this year will be Brooks, our running-shoe company. Brooks has beengobbling up market share and in 2011 had a sales gain of 34%, its tenth consecutive year of record volume. Dropby and congratulate Jim Weber, the company’s CEO. And be sure to buy a couple of pairs of limited edition“Berkshire Hathaway Running Shoes.”GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all ofthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you ashareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which weoperate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that givencertain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money. Forat least half of you, I believe we can.Be sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry more than 35 books and DVDs, including a couple of newones. I recommendMiTek, an informative history of one of our very successful subsidiaries. You’ll learn how myinterest in the company was originally piqued by my receiving in the mail a hunk of ugly metal whose purpose Icouldn’t fathom. Since we bought MiTek in 2001, it has made 33 “tuck-in” acquisitions, almost all successful. Ithink you’ll also like a short book that Peter Bevelin has put together explaining Berkshire’s investment andoperating principles. It sums up what Charlie and I have been saying over the years in annual reports and atannual meetings. Should you need to ship your book purchases, a shipping service will be available nearby.If you are a big spender – or aspire to become one – visit Elliott Aviation on the east side of the Omahaairport between noon and 5:00 p.m. on Saturday. There we will have a fleet of NetJets aircraft that will get yourpulse racing. Come by bus; leave by private jet. I’ll OK your credit.An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain thecredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. Airlines have sometimes jacked up pricesfor the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City versusOmaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2
1⁄2hours, and it may be that you can save significant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. Spend the savings with us. 20At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72ndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. Last year the store did $32.7 million of businessduring its annual meeting sale, a volume that exceeds the yearly sales of most furniture stores. To obtain theBerkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, May 1
stand Monday, May 7thinclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even apply to the products of severalprestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit ofour shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. NFM is openfrom10a.m.to9p.m.MondaythroughSaturday,and10a.m.to6p.m.onSunday.OnSaturdaythisyear,from5:30p.m.to 8 p.m., NFM is having a picnic to which you are all invited.At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail receptionfrom 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May 4
th. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 6th, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. On Sunday, around 2 p.m., I will be clerking atBorsheims, desperate to beat my sales figure from last year. So come take advantage of me. Ask me for my“Crazy Warren” price.We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 30
ththrough Saturday, May 12th. During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement thatshows you are a Berkshire holder.On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion,will take on all comers – who will have their eyes wide open – in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, aremarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and SharonOsberg, two of the world’s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sundayafternoon. Two non-experts – Charlie and I – will also be at the tables.Gorat’s and Piccolo’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 6
th. Both will be serving until 10 p.m., with Gorat’s opening at 1 p.m. and Piccolo’s opening at 4 p.m. Theserestaurants are my favorites, and I will eat at both of them on Sunday evening. (Actuarial tables tell me that I canconsume another 12 million calories before my death. I’m terrified at the thought of leaving any of these behind,so will be frontloading on Sunday.) Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call 402-551-3733 on April 1
st
(but not before) and at Piccolo’s, call 402-342-9038. At Piccolo’s, show some class and order a giant root beerfloat for dessert. Only sissies get the small one.We will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at themeeting, asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalistsand their e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be e-mailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com;Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com, and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times,at arsorkin@nytimes.com.From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the dozen or so he or she decides are themost interesting and important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selectedif you keep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more thantwo questions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your namementioned if your question is selected.)This year we are adding a second panel of three financial analysts who follow Berkshire. They are CliffGallant of KBW, Jay Gelb of Barclays Capital and Gary Ransom of Dowling and Partners. These analysts willbring their own Berkshire-specific questions and alternate with the journalists and the audience.
Charlie and I believe that all shareholders should have access to new Berkshire information simultaneouslyand should also have adequate time to analyze it, which is why we try to issue financial information after the marketclose on a Friday. We do not talk one-on-one to large institutional investors or analysts. Our new panel will letanalysts ask questions – perhaps even a few technical ones – in a manner that may be helpful to many shareholders.
21Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know thejournalists and analysts will come up with some tough ones, and that’s the way we like it. All told, we expect atleast 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and 18 from the audience. If there issome extra time, we will take more from the audience. Audience questioners will be determined by drawings thatwill take place at 8:15 a.m. at each of the 13 microphones located in the arena and main overflow room.************For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are trulyAll-Stars, who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I believe their mindsetto be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most have nofinancial need to work; the joy of hitting business “home runs” means as much to them as their paycheck.Equally important, however, are the 23 men and women who work with me at our corporate office (allon one floor, which is the way we intend to keep it!).This group efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements and files a17,839-page Federal income tax return – hello, Guinness! – as well as state and foreign returns. Additionally,they respond to countless shareholder and media inquiries, get out the annual report, prepare for the country’slargest annual meeting, coordinate the Board’s activities – and the list goes on and on.They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easyand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: They deal with 48 universities (selectedfrom 200 applicants) who will send students to Omaha this school year for a day with me and also handle all kindsof requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers for lunch. No CEO has it better.This home office crew, along with our operating managers, has my deepest thanks and deserves yoursas well. Come to Omaha – the cradle of capitalism – on May 5

Notes:Data are for calendar years with these exceptions: 1965 and 1966, year ended 9/30; 1967, 15 months ended12/31. Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold atmarket rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire’sresults through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculatedusing the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-taxwhereas the Berkshire numbers areafter- tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, itsresults would have lagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded theS&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused theaggregate lag to be substantial.
2BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:In 2012, Berkshire achieved a total gain for its shareholders of $24.1 billion. We used $1.3 billion of thatto repurchase our stock, which left us with an increase in net worth of $22.8 billion for the year. The per-share bookvalue of both our Class A and Class B stock increased by 14.4%. Over the last 48 years (that is, since presentmanagement took over), book value has grown from $19 to $114,214, a rate of 19.7% compounded annually.*A number of good things happened at Berkshire last year, but let’s first get the bad news out of the way.
ŠWhen the partnership I ran took control of Berkshire in 1965, I could never have dreamed that a year inwhich we had a gain of $24.1 billion would be subpar, in terms of the comparison we present on the facingpage.But subpar it was. For the ninth time in 48 years, Berkshire’s percentage increase in book value was lessthan the S&P’s percentage gain (a calculation that includes dividends as well as price appreciation). Ineight of those nine years, it should be noted, the S&P had a gain of 15% or more. We do better when thewind is in our face.To date, we’ve never had a five-year period of underperformance, having managed 43 times to surpass theS&P over such a stretch. (The record is on page 103.) But the S&P has now had gains in each of the lastfour years, outpacing us over that period. If the market continues to advance in 2013, our streak of five-year wins will end.One thing of which you can be certain: Whatever Berkshire’s results, my partner Charlie Munger, thecompany’s Vice Chairman, and I will not change yardsticks. It’s our jobto increase intrinsic business value – for which we use book value as a significantly understatedproxy – at a faster rate than the market gains of the S&P. If we do so, Berkshire’s share price, though unpredictable from year to year, will itselfoutpace the S&P over time. If we fail, however, our management will bring no value to our investors, whothemselves can earn S&P returns by buying a low-cost index fund.
Charlie and I believe the gain in Berkshire’s intrinsic value will over time likely surpass the S&P returns bya small margin. We’re confident of that because we have some outstanding businesses, a cadre of terrificoperating managers and a shareholder-oriented culture. Our relative performance, however, is almostcertain to be better when the market is down or flat. In years when the market is particularly strong, expectus to fall short.
ŠThe second disappointment in 2012 was my inability to make a major acquisition. I pursued a couple ofelephants, but came up empty-handed.
* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are1/1500
thof those shown for A. 3Our luck, however, changed early this year. In February, we agreed to buy 50% of a holding company thatwill own all of H. J. Heinz. The other half will be owned by a small group of investors led by Jorge PauloLemann, a renowned Brazilian businessman and philanthropist.
We couldn’t be in better company. Jorge Paulo is a long-time friend of mine and an extraordinarymanager. His group and Berkshire will each contribute about $4 billion for common equity in the holdingcompany. Berkshire will also invest $8 billion in preferred shares that pay a 9% dividend. The preferredhas two other features that materially increase its value: at some point it will be redeemed at a significantpremium price and the preferred also comes with warrants permitting us to buy 5% of the holdingcompany’s common stock for a nominal sum.
Our total investment of about $12 billion soaks up much of what Berkshire earned last year. But we stillhave plenty of cash and are generating more at a good clip. So it’s back to work; Charlie and I have againdonned our safari outfits and resumed our search for elephants.Now to some good news from 2012:
ŠLast year I told you that BNSF, Iscar, Lubrizol, Marmon Group and MidAmerican Energy – our five mostprofitable non-insurance companies – were likely to earn more than $10 billion pre-tax in 2012. Theydelivered. Despite tepid U.S. growth and weakening economies throughout much of the world, our“powerhouse five” had aggregate earnings of $10.1 billion, about $600 million more than in 2011.Of this group, only MidAmerican, then earning $393 million pre-tax, was owned by Berkshire eight yearsago. Subsequently, we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth,BNSF, we paid about 70% of the cost in cash, and for the remainder, issued shares that increased theamount outstanding by 6.1%. Consequently, the $9.7 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshireby the five companies has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfies our goal of not simplygrowing, but rather increasingper-shareresults.
Unless the U.S. economy tanks – which we don’t expect – our powerhouse five should again deliver higherearnings in 2013. The five outstanding CEOs who run them will see to that.
ŠThough I failed to land a major acquisition in 2012, the managers of our subsidiaries did far better. We hada record year for “bolt-on” purchases, spending about $2.3 billion for 26 companies that were melded intoour existing businesses. These transactions were completed without Berkshire issuing anyshares.
Charlie and I love these acquisitions: Usually they are low-risk, burden headquarters not at all, and expandthe scope of our proven managers.
ŠOur insurance operations shot the lights out last year. While giving Berkshire $73 billion of freemoney to invest, they also delivered a $1.6 billion underwriting gain, the tenth consecutive year of profitableunderwriting. This is truly having your cake and eating it too.
GEICO led the way, continuing to gobble up market share without sacrificing underwriting discipline.Since 1995, when we obtained control, GEICO’s share of the personal-auto market has grown from 2.5% to9.7%. Premium volume meanwhile increased from $2.8 billion to $16.7 billion. Much more growth liesahead.The credit for GEICO’s extraordinary performance goes to Tony Nicely and his 27,000 associates. And tothat cast, we should add our Gecko. Neither rain nor storm nor gloom of night can stop him; the little lizardjust soldiers on, telling Americans how they can save big money by going to GEICO.com.
When I count my blessings, I count GEICO twice.4ŠTodd Combs and Ted Weschler, our new investment managers, have proved to be smart, models ofintegrity, helpful to Berkshire in many ways beyond portfolio management, and a perfect cultural fit. Wehit the jackpot with these two. In 2012 each outperformed the S&P 500 by double-digit margins.
They left me inthe dust as well
.Consequently, we have increased the funds managed by each to almost $5 billion (some of this emanatingfrom the pension funds of our subsidiaries). Todd and Ted are young and will be around to manageBerkshire’s massive portfolio long after Charlie and I have left the scene. You can rest easy when theytake over.
ŠBerkshire’s yearend employment totaled a record 288,462 (see page 106 for details), up 17,604 from lastyear. Our headquarters crew, however, remained unchanged at 24. No sense going crazy.
ŠBerkshire’s “Big Four” investments – American Express, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo – all had goodyears. Our ownership interest in each of these companies increased during the year. We purchasedadditional shares of Wells Fargo (our ownership now is 8.7% versus 7.6% at yearend 2011) and IBM (6.0%versus 5.5%). Meanwhile, stock repurchases at Coca-Cola and American Express raised our percentageownership. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from 8.8% to 8.9% and our interest at American Express from13.0% to 13.7%.
Berkshire’s ownership interest in all four companies is likely to increase in the future. Mae West had itright: “Too much of a good thing can be wonderful.”The four companies possess marvelous businesses and are run by managers who are both talented andshareholder-oriented. At Berkshire we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of awonderful business to owning 100% of a so-so business. Our flexibility in capital allocation gives us asignificant advantage over companies that limit themselves only to acquisitions they can operate.Going by our yearend share count, our portion of the “Big Four’s” 2012 earnings amounted to $3.9 billion.In the earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends we receive – about $1.1 billion.But make no mistake: The $2.8 billion of earnings we do not report is every bit as valuable to us as whatwe record.The earnings that the four companies retain are often used for repurchases – which enhance our share offuture earnings – and also for funding business opportunities that are usually advantageous. Over time weexpect substantially greater earnings from these four investees. If we are correct, dividends to Berkshirewill increase and, even more important, so will our unrealized capital gains (which, for the four, totaled$26.7 billion at yearend).
ŠThere was a lot of hand-wringing last year among CEOs who cried “uncertainty” when faced with capital-allocation decisions (despite many of their businesses having enjoyed record levels of both earnings andcash). At Berkshire, we didn’t share their fears, instead spending a record $9.8 billion on plant andequipment in 2012, about 88% of it in the United States. That’s 19% more than we spent in 2011, ourprevious high. Charlie and I love investing large sums in worthwhile projects, whatever the pundits aresaying. We instead heed the words from Gary Allan’s new country song, “Every Storm Runs Out of Rain.”
We will keep our foot to the floor and will almost certainly set still another record for capital expendituresin 2013. Opportunities abound in America.************A thought for my fellow CEOs: Of course, the immediate future is uncertain; America has faced theunknown since 1776. It’s just that sometimes people focus on the myriad of uncertainties that always existwhile at other times they ignore them (usually because the recent past has been uneventful).5American business will do fine over time. And stocks will do well just as certainly, since their fate is tiedto business performance. Periodic setbacks will occur, yes, but investors and managers are in a game thatis heavily stacked in their favor. (The Dow Jones Industrials advanced from 66 to 11,497 in the 20
th
Century, a staggering 17,320% increase that materialized despite four costly wars, a Great Depression andmany recessions. And don’t forget that shareholders received substantial dividends throughout the centuryas well.)Since the basic game is so favorable, Charlie and I believe it’s a terrible mistake to try to dance in and outof it based upon the turn of tarot cards, the predictions of “experts,” or the ebb and flow of businessactivity. The risks of being out of the game are huge compared to the risks of being in it.My own history provides a dramatic example: I made my first stock purchase in the spring of 1942 whenthe U.S. was suffering major losses throughout the Pacific war zone. Each day’s headlines told of moresetbacks. Even so, there was no talk about uncertainty; everyAmerican I knew believed we would prevail. The country’s success since that perilous time boggles the mind: On an inflation-adjusted basis, GDP percapita more thanquadrupledbetween 1941 and 2012. Throughout that period, everytomorrow has been uncertain. America’s destiny, however, has always been clear: ever-increasing abundance.If you are a CEO who has some large, profitable project you are shelving because of short-term worries,call Berkshire. Let us unburden you.************
In summary, Charlie and I hope to build per-share intrinsic value by (1) improving the earning power of ourmany subsidiaries; (2) further increasing their earnings through bolt-on acquisitions; (3) participating in the growthof our investees; (4) repurchasing Berkshire shares when they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsicvalue; and (5) making an occasional large acquisition. We will also try to maximize results for youby rarely, if ever, issuing Berkshire shares.
Those building blocks rest on a rock-solid foundation. A century hence, BNSF and MidAmerican Energywill continue to play major roles in the American economy. Insurance, moreover, will always be essential for bothbusinesses and individuals – and no company brings greater resources to that arena than Berkshire. As we viewthese and other strengths, Charlie and I like your company’s prospects.Intrinsic Business Value
As much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that numberis for Berkshire shares (or, for that matter, any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid out thethree elements – one of which was qualitative – that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire’sintrinsic value. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 104-105.
Here is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2012 our per-share investments increased 15.7% to$113,786, and our per-share pre-tax earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments also increased15.7% to $8,085.Since 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 19.4% compounded annually, and ourper-share earnings figure has grown at a 20.8% clip. It is no coincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the42-year period has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to seegains in both areas, but our strong emphasis will always be on building operating earnings.************Now, let’s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet andincome characteristics from the others. Lumping them together therefore impedes analysis. So we’ll present themas four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them.6InsuranceLet’s look first at insurance, Berkshire’s core operation and the engine that has propelled our expansionover the years.Property-casualty (“P/C”) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, suchas those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others.Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire’s benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go,the amount of float we hold remains quite stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our businessgrows, so does our float. Andhowwe have grown, as the following table shows:Year
Float (in $ millions)
1970 $ 391980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322012 73,125Last year I told you that our float was likely to level off or even decline a bit in the future. Our insuranceCEOs set out to prove me wrong anddid, increasing float last year by $2.5 billion. I now expect a further increasein 2013. But further gains will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO’s float will almost certainly grow. InNational Indemnity’s reinsurance division, however, we have a number of run-off contracts whose float driftsdownward. If we do experience a decline in float at some future time, it will be verygradual – at the outside no more than 2% in any year.
If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profitthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money– and, better yet, getpaidfor holding it. That’s like your taking out a loan and having the bank pay youinterest.
Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorousin most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State Farm, by far the country’s largest insurer and awell-managed company besides, incurred an underwriting loss in eight of the eleven years ending in 2011. (Theirfinancials for 2012 are not yet available.) There are a lot of ways to lose money in insurance, and the industry neverceases searching for new ones.As noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for tenconsecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $18.6 billion. Looking ahead, I believe we willcontinue to underwrite profitably in most years. If we do, our float will be better than free money.
So how does our attractive float affect the calculations of intrinsic value? When Berkshire’s book value iscalculated, thefullamount of our float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and wereunable to replenish it. But that’s an incorrect way to look at float, which should instead be viewed as a revolvingfund. If float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe Berkshire’s will be, the true value of this liability isdramaticallyless than the accounting liability.
A partial offset to this overstated liability is $15.5 billion of “goodwill” that is attributable to our insurancecompanies and included in book value as an asset. In effect, this goodwill represents the price we paid for the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing on its true value. For example, if an insurance business sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwill assetcarried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.7Fortunately, that’s not the case at Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our insurancegoodwill – what we would happily pay to purchase an insurance operation producing float of similar quality–t ob e far in excess of its historic carrying value. The value of our float is one reason – a huge reason – why we believeBerkshire’s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.
Let me emphasize once again that cost-free float is notan outcome to be expected for the P/C industry as a whole: There is very little “Berkshire-quality” float existing in the insurance world. In 37 of the 45 years ending in2011, the industry’s premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the industry’soverall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized by Americanindustry, a sorry performance almost certain to continue.A further unpleasant reality adds to the industry’s dim prospects: Insurance earnings are now benefittingfrom “legacy” bond portfolios that deliver much higher yields than will be available when funds are reinvestedduring the next few years – and perhaps for many years beyond that. Today’s bond portfolios are, in effect, wastingassets. Earnings of insurers will be hurt in a significant way as bonds mature and are rolled over.************Berkshire’s outstanding economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running someextraordinary insurance operations. Let me tell you about the major units.First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, run by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks that noone else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, mostimportant, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that areinappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are farmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe– a loss about triple anything it has ever experienced – Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profitfor the year because it has so many streams of earnings. All other major insurers and reinsurers would meanwhilebe far in the red, with some facing insolvency.From a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $35 billion and asignificant cumulative underwriting profit, a feat that no other insurance CEO has come close to matching. He hasthus added a great many billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire. If you meet Ajit at the annual meeting, bowdeeply.************We have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.
At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all exposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actuallycausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after bothprospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriatepremium can’t be obtained.
Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can’t turn their back on businessthat is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, “The other guy is doing it, so we must as well,”spells trouble in any business, but none more so than insurance.
8Tad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re’s hugefloat has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, it will continue to be. Weare particularly enthusiastic about General Re’s international life reinsurance business, which has achievedconsistent and profitable growth since we acquired the company in 1998.************Finally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 62 years ago. GEICO is run by Tony Nicely,who joined the company at 18 and completed 51 years of service in 2012.I rub my eyes when I look at what Tony has accomplished. Last year, it should be noted, his record wasconsiderably better than is indicated by GEICO’s GAAP underwriting profit of $680 million. Because of a changein accounting rules at the beginning of the year, we recorded a charge to GEICO’s underwriting earnings of$410 million. This item hadnothingto do with 2012’s operating results, changing neither cash, revenues, expensesnor taxes. In effect, the writedown simply widened the already huge difference between GEICO’s intrinsic valueand the value at which we carry it on our books.GEICO earned its underwriting profit, moreover, despite the company suffering its largest single loss inhistory. The cause was Hurricane Sandy, which cost GEICO more than three times the loss it sustained fromKatrina, the previous record-holder. We insured 46,906 vehicles that were destroyed or damaged in the storm, astaggering number reflecting GEICO’s leading market share in the New York metropolitan area.Last year GEICO enjoyed a meaningful increase in both the renewal rate for existing policyholders(“persistency”) and in the percentage of rate quotations that resulted in sales (“closures”). Big dollars ride on thosetwo factors: A sustained gain in persistency of a bare one percentage point increases intrinsic value by more than$1 billion. GEICO’s gains in 2012 offer dramatic proof that when people check the company’s prices, they usuallyfind they can save important sums. (Give us a try at 1-800-847-7536 or GEICO.com. Be sure to mention that you are ashareholder; that fact will usually result in a discount.)************In addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies, most of themplying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world. In aggregate, these companies have consistently deliveredan underwriting profit. Moreover, as the table below shows, they also provide us with substantial float. Charlie andI treasure these companies and their managers.Late in 2012, we enlarged this group by acquiring Guard Insurance, a Wilkes-Barre company that writesworkers compensation insurance, primarily for smaller businesses. Guard’s annual premiums total about $300million. The company has excellent prospects for growth in both its traditional business and new lines it has begunto offer.Underwriting Profit

*After a $410 million charge against earnings arising from an industry-wide accounting change.Among large insurance operations, Berkshire’s impresses me as the best in the world. It was our lucky daywhen, in March 1967, Jack Ringwalt sold us his two property-casualty insurers for $8.6 million.9Regulated, Capital-Intensive BusinessesWe have two major operations, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, that have important commoncharacteristics distinguishing them from our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section inthis letter and split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.
A key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, withthese partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact not needed because each business has earning power that even under terrible conditions amply covers its interestrequirements. In last year’s tepid economy, for example, BNSF’s interest coverage was 9.6x. (Our definition ofcoverage is pre-tax earnings/interest,notEBITDA/interest, a commonly-used measure we view as deeply flawed.)At MidAmerican, meanwhile, two key factors ensure its ability to service debt under all circumstances: thecompany’s recession-resistant earnings, which result from our exclusively offering an essential service, and its greatdiversity of earnings streams, which shield it from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body.
Every day, our two subsidiaries power the American economy in major ways:
ŠBNSF carries about 15% (measured by ton-miles) of allinter-city freight, whether it is transported by truck, rail, water, air, or pipeline. Indeed, we move more ton-miles of goods than anyoneelse, a fact making BNSF the most important artery in our economy’s circulatory system.
BNSF also moves its cargo in an extraordinarily fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly way, carrying aton of freight about 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. Trucks taking on the same job guzzle aboutfour times as much fuel.
ŠMidAmerican’s electric utilities serve regulated retail customers in ten states. Only one utility holdingcompany serves more states. In addition, we are the leader in renewables: first, from a standing start nineyears ago, we now account for 6% of the country’s wind generation capacity. Second, when we completethree projects now under construction, we will own about 14% of U.S. solar-generation capacity.Projects like these require huge capital investments. Upon completion, indeed, our renewables portfoliowill have cost $13 billion. We relish making such commitments if they promise reasonable returns – and on thatfront, we put a large amount of trust in future regulation.Our confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever needmassive investment in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capitalproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. And it is in our self-interestto conduct our operations in a manner that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent.Our managers must think today of what the country will need far down the road. Energy and transportationprojects can take many years to come to fruition; a growing country simply can’t afford to get behind the curve.We have been doing our part to make sure that doesn’t happen. Whatever you may have heard about ourcountry’s crumbling infrastructure in no way applies to BNSF or railroads generally. America’s rail system hasnever been in better shape, a consequence of huge investments by the industry. We are not, however, resting on ourlaurels: BNSF will spend about $4 billion on the railroad in 2013, roughly double its depreciation charge and morethan any railroad has spent in a single year.
10In Matt Rose, at BNSF, and Greg Abel, at MidAmerican, we have two outstanding CEOs. They areextraordinary managers who have developed businesses that serve both their customers and owners well. Each hasmy gratitude and each deserves yours. Here are the key figures for their businesses:MidAmerican (89.8% owned)

Sharp-eyed readers will notice an incongruity in the MidAmerican earnings tabulation. What in the worldis HomeServices, a real estate brokerage operation, doing in a section entitled “Regulated, Capital-IntensiveBusinesses?”Well, its ownership came with MidAmerican when we bought control of that company in 2000. At thattime, I focused on MidAmerican’s utility operations and barely noticed HomeServices, which then owned only afew real estate brokerage companies.Since then, however, the company has regularly added residential brokers – three in 2012 – and now hasabout 16,000 agents in a string of major U.S. cities. (Our real estate brokerage companies are listed on page 107.)In 2012, our agents participated in $42 billion of home sales, up 33% from 2011.Additionally, HomeServices last year purchased 67% of the Prudential and Real Living franchiseoperations, which together license 544 brokerage companies throughout the country and receive a small royalty ontheir sales. We have an arrangement to purchase the balance of those operations within five years. In the comingyears, we will gradually rebrand both our franchisees and the franchise firms we own as Berkshire HathawayHomeServices.Ron Peltier has done an outstanding job in managing HomeServices during a depressed period. Now, asthe housing market continues to strengthen, we expect earnings to rise significantly.

*Includes earnings of Lubrizol from September 16.Our income and expense data conforming to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) is onpage 29. In contrast, the operating expense figures above are non-GAAP. In particular, they exclude somepurchase-accounting items, primarily the amortization of certain intangible assets. We present the data in thismanner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbers more accurately reflect the real expenses and profits ofthe businesses aggregated in the table.
I won’t explain all of the adjustments – some are small and arcane – but serious investors shouldunderstand the disparate nature of intangible assets: Some truly deplete over time while others never lose value.With software, for example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Charges against other intangibles such asthe amortization of customer relationships, however, arise through purchase-accounting rules and are clearly not realexpenses. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both, that is, are recorded asexpenses when calculating earnings – even though from an investor’s viewpoint they could not be more different.
In the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 29, amortization charges of $600 million for thecompanies included in this section are deducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these “real” – and indeedthat is the portion we have included in the table above – and the rest not. This difference has become significantbecause of the many acquisitions we have made.“Non-real” amortization expense also looms large at some of our major investees. IBM has made manysmall acquisitions in recent years and now regularly reports “adjusted operating earnings,” a non-GAAP figure thatexcludes certain purchase-accounting adjustments. Analysts focus on this number, as they should.
12A “non-real” amortization charge at Wells Fargo, however, is not highlighted by the company and never, tomy knowledge, has been noted in analyst reports. The earnings that Wells Fargo reports are heavily burdened by an“amortization of core deposits” charge, the implication being that these deposits are disappearing at a fairly rapidclip. Yet core deposits regularlyincrease. The charge last year was about $1.5 billion. In nosense, except GAAP accounting, is this whopping charge an expense.
And that ends today’s accounting lecture. Why is no one shouting “More, more?”************The crowd of companies in this section sell products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of thebusinesses enjoy terrific economics, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangibleassets that run from 25% after-tax to more than 100%. Others produce good returns in the area of 12-20%. A few, however, have very poorreturns, a result of some serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation.
More than 50 years ago, Charlie told me that it was far better to buy a wonderful business at a fair pricethan to buy a fair business at a wonderful price. Despite the compelling logic of his position, I have sometimesreverted to my old habit of bargain-hunting, with results ranging from tolerable to terrible. Fortunately, my mistakeshave usually occurred when I made smaller purchases. Our large acquisitions have generally worked out well and,in a few cases, more than well.
Viewed as a single entity, therefore, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employ$22.6 billion of net tangible assets and, on that base, earned 16.3% after-tax.
Of course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if the price paid is excessive. Wehave paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the largefigure we show for intangible assets. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we havedeployed in this sector. Furthermore, the intrinsic value of the businesses, in aggregate, exceeds their carrying valueby a good margin. Even so, the difference between intrinsic value and carrying value in the insurance and regulated-industry segments isfargreater. It is there that the huge winners reside.
************Marmon provides an example of a clear and substantial gap existing between book value and intrinsicvalue. Let me explain the odd origin of this differential.Last year I told you that we had purchased additional shares in Marmon, raising our ownership to 80% (upfrom the 64% we acquired in 2008). I also told you that GAAP accounting required us to immediately record the2011 purchase on our books at far less than what we paid. I’ve now had a year to think about this weird accountingrule, but I’ve yet to find an explanation that makes anysense – nor can Charlie or Marc Hamburg, our CFO, come up with one. My confusion increases when I am told that if we hadn’t already owned 64%, the 16% we purchasedin 2011 would have been entered on our books at our cost.
In 2012 (and in early 2013, retroactive to yearend 2012) we acquired an additional 10% of Marmon and thesame bizarre accounting treatment was required. The $700 million write-off we immediately incurred had no effecton earnings but did reduce book value and, therefore, 2012’s gain in net worth.
The cost of our recent 10% purchase implies a $12.6 billion value for the 90% of Marmon we now own.Our balance-sheet carrying value for the 90%, however, is $8 billion. Charlie and I believe our current purchaserepresents excellent value. If we are correct, our Marmon holding is worth at least $4.6 billion more than itscarrying value.
Marmon is a diverse enterprise, comprised of about 150 companies operating in a wide variety ofindustries. Its largest business involves the ownership of tank cars that are leased to a variety of shippers, such as oiland chemical companies. Marmon conducts this business through two subsidiaries, Union Tank Car in the U.S. andProcor in Canada.
13Union Tank Car has been around a long time, having been owned by the Standard Oil Trust until thatempire was broken up in 1911. Look for its UTLX logo on tank cars when you watch trains roll by. As a Berkshireshareholder, you own the cars with that insignia. When you spot a UTLX car, puff out your chest a bit and enjoy thesame satisfaction that John D. Rockefeller undoubtedly experienced as he viewed hisfleet a century ago. Tank cars are owned by either shippers or lessors, not by railroads. At yearend Union Tank Car and Procortogether owned 97,000 cars having a net book value of $4 billion. A new car, it should be noted, costs upwards of$100,000. Union Tank Car is also a major manufacturer of tank cars – some of them to be sold but most to beowned by it and leased out. Today, its order book extends well into 2014.At both BNSF and Marmon, we are benefitting from the resurgence of U.S. oil production. In fact, ourrailroad is now transporting about 500,000 barrels of oil daily, roughly 10% of the total produced in the “lower 48”(i.e. not counting Alaska and offshore). All indications are that BNSF’s oil shipments will grow substantially incoming years.************Space precludes us from going into detail about the many other businesses in this segment. Company-specific information about the 2012 operations of some of the larger units appears on pages 76 to 79.Finance and Financial ProductsThis sector, our smallest, includes two rental companies, XTRA (trailers) and CORT (furniture), as well asClayton Homes, the country’s leading producer and financer of manufactured homes. Aside from these 100%-owned subsidiaries, we also include in this category a collection of financial assets and our 50% interest in BerkadiaCommercial Mortgage.We include Clayton in this sector because it owns and services 332,000 mortgages, totaling $13.7 billion.In large part, these loans have been made to lower and middle-income families. Nevertheless, the loans haveperformed well throughout the housing collapse, thereby validating our conviction that a reasonable down paymentand a sensible payments-to-income ratio will ward off outsized foreclosure losses, even during stressful times.Clayton also produced 25,872 manufactured homes last year, up 13.5% from 2011. That output accountedfor about 4.8% of all single-family residences built in the country, a share that makes Clayton America’s numberone homebuilder.CORT and XTRA are leaders in their industries as well. Our expenditures for new rental equipment atXTRA totaled $256 million in 2012, more than double its depreciation expense. While competitors fret abouttoday’s uncertainties, XTRA is preparing for tomorrow.Berkadia continues to do well. Our partners at Leucadia do most of the work in this venture, anarrangement that Charlie and I happily embrace.Here’s the pre-tax earnings recap for this sector:

*This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP “cost” differs in a few cases because ofwrite-ups or write-downs that have been required.
One point about the composition of this list deserves mention. In Berkshire’s past annual reports, everystock itemized in this space has been bought by me, in the sense that I made the decision to buy it for Berkshire. Butstarting with this list, any investment made by Todd Combs or Ted Weschler – or a combined purchase by them –that meets the dollar threshold for the list ($1 billion this year) will be included. Above is the first such stock,DIRECTV, which both Todd and Ted hold in their portfolios and whose combined holdings at the end of 2012 werevalued at the $1.15 billion shown.
Todd and Ted also manage the pension funds of certain Berkshire subsidiaries, while others, for regulatoryreasons, are managed by outside advisers. We do not include holdings of the pension funds in our annual reporttabulations, though their portfolios often overlap Berkshire’s.************We continue to wind down the part of our derivatives portfolio that involved the assumption by Berkshireof insurance-like risks. (Our electric and gas utility businesses, however, will continue to use derivatives foroperational purposes.) New commitments would require us to post collateral and, with minor exceptions, we areunwilling to do that. Markets can behave in extraordinary ways, and we have no interest in exposing Berkshire tosome out-of-the-blue event in the financial world that might require our posting mountains of cash on a moment’snotice.Charlie and I believe in operating with many redundant layers of liquidity, and we avoid any sort ofobligation that could drain our cash in a material way. That reduces our returns in 99 years out of 100. But we willsurvive in the 100
thwhile many others fail. And we will sleep well in all 100.15The derivatives we have sold that provide credit protection for corporate bonds will all expire in the nextyear. It’s now almost certain that our profit from these contracts will approximate $1 billion pre-tax. We alsoreceived very substantial sums upfront on these derivatives, and the “float” attributable to them has averaged about$2 billion over their five-year lives. All told, these derivatives have provided a more-than-satisfactory result,especially considering the fact that we were guaranteeing corporate credits – mostly of the high-yield variety –throughout the financial panic and subsequent recession.In our other major derivatives commitment, we sold long-term puts on four leading stock indices in theU.S., U.K., Europe and Japan. These contracts were initiated between 2004 and 2008 and even under the worst ofcircumstances have only minor collateral requirements. In 2010 we unwound about 10% of our exposure at a profitof $222 million. The remaining contracts expire between 2018 and 2026. Only the index value at expiration datecounts; our counterparties have no right to early termination.
Berkshire received premiums of $4.2 billion when we wrote the contracts that remain outstanding. If all ofthese contracts had come due at yearend 2011, we would have had to pay $6.2 billion; the corresponding figure atyearend 2012 was $3.9 billion. With this large drop in immediate settlement liability, we reduced our GAAPliability at yearend 2012 to $7.5 billion from $8.5 billion at the end of 2011. Though it’s no sure thing, Charlie and Ibelieve it likely that the final liability will be considerably less than the amount we currently carry on our books. Inthe meantime, we can invest the $4.2 billion of float derived from these contracts as we see fit.
We Buy Some Newspapers . . . Newspapers?During the past fifteen months, we acquired 28 daily newspapers at a cost of $344 million. This maypuzzle you for two reasons. First, I have long told you in these letters and at our annual meetings that thecirculation, advertising and profits of the newspaper industry overall are certainto decline. That prediction still holds. Second, the properties we purchased fell far short of meeting our oft-stated size requirements foracquisitions.We can address the second point easily. Charlie and I love newspapers and, if their economics make sense, will buy them even when they fall far short of the size threshold we would require for the purchase of, say, a widgetcompany. Addressing the first point requires me to provide a more elaborate explanation, including some history.News, to put it simply, is what people don’t know that they want to know. And people will seek their news– what’s important tothem– from whatever sources provide the best combination of immediacy, ease of access,reliability, comprehensiveness and low cost. The relative importance of these factors varies with the nature of thenews and the person wanting it.
Before television and the Internet, newspapers were the primarysource for an incredible variety of news, a fact that made them indispensable to a very high percentage of the population. Whether your interests wereinternational, national, local, sports or financial quotations, your newspaper usually was first to tell you the latestinformation. Indeed, your paper contained so much you wanted to learn that you received your money’s worth, evenif only a small number of its pages spoke to your specific interests. Better yet, advertisers typically paid almost allof the product’s cost, and readers rode their coattails.Additionally, the ads themselves delivered information of vital interest to hordes of readers, in effectproviding even more “news.” Editors would cringe at the thought, but for many readers learning what jobs orapartments were available, what supermarkets were carrying which weekend specials, or what movies were showingwhere and when was far more important than the views expressed on the editorial page.
16In turn, the local paper was indispensable to advertisers. If Sears or Safeway built stores in Omaha, theyrequired a “megaphone” to tell the city’s residents why their stores should be visited today. Indeed, big department stores and grocers vied to outshout their competition with multi-page spreads, knowing that the goods theyadvertised would fly off the shelves. With no other megaphone remotely comparable to that of the newspaper, adssold themselves.As long as a newspaper was the only one in its community, its profits were certain to be extraordinary;whether it was managed well or poorly made little difference. (As one Southern publisher famously confessed, “Iowe my exalted position in life to two great American institutions – nepotism and monopoly.”)Over the years, almost all cities became one-newspaper towns (or harbored two competing papers thatjoined forces to operate as a single economic unit). This contraction was inevitable because most people wished toread and pay for only one paper. When competition existed, the paper that gained a significant lead in circulationalmost automatically received the most ads. That left ads drawing readers and readers drawing ads. This symbioticprocess spelled doom for the weaker paper and became known as “survival of the fattest.”
Now the world has changed. Stock market quotes and the details of national sports events are old newslong before the presses begin to roll. The Internet offers extensive information about both available jobs and homes.Television bombards viewers with political, national and international news. In one area of interest after another,newspapers have therefore lost their “primacy.” And, as their audiences have fallen, so has advertising. (Revenuesfrom “help wanted” classified ads – long a huge source of income for newspapers – have plunged more than 90% inthe past 12 years.)Newspapers continue to reign supreme, however, in the delivery of local news. If you want to know what’sgoing on inyourtown – whether the news is about the mayor or taxes or high school football – there is no substitutefor a local newspaper that is doing its job. A reader’s eyes may glaze over after they take in a couple of paragraphsabout Canadian tariffs or political developments in Pakistan; a story about the reader himself or his neighbors willbe read to the end. Wherever there is a pervasive sense of community, a paper that serves the special informationalneeds of that community will remain indispensable to a significant portion of its residents.
Even a valuable product, however, can self-destruct from a faulty business strategy. And that process hasbeen underway during the past decade at almost all papers of size. Publishers – including Berkshire in Buffalo –have offered their paper free on the Internet while charging meaningful sums for the physical specimen. How couldthis lead to anything other than a sharp and steady drop in sales of the printed product? Falling circulation,moreover, makes a paper less essential to advertisers. Under these conditions, the “virtuous circle” of the pastreverses.The Wall Street Journalwent to a pay model early. But the main exemplar for local newspapers is theArkansas Democrat-Gazette, published by Walter Hussman, Jr. Walter also adopted a pay format early, and overthe past decade his paper has retained its circulation far better than any other large paper in the country. DespiteWalter’s powerful example, it’s only been in the last year or so that other papers, including Berkshire’s, haveexplored pay arrangements. Whatever works best – and the answer is not yet clear – will be copied widely.************Charlie and I believe that papers delivering comprehensive and reliable information to tightly-boundcommunitiesandhaving a sensible Internet strategy will remain viable for a long time. We do not believe thatsuccess will come from cutting either the news content or frequency of publication. Indeed, skimpy news coveragewill almost certainly lead to skimpy readership. And the less-than-daily publication that is now being tried in somelarge towns or cities – while it may improve profits in the short term – seems certain to diminish the papers’relevance over time. Our goal is to keep our papers loaded with content of interest to our readers and to be paidappropriately by those who find us useful, whether the product they view is in their hands or on the Internet.
17Our confidence is buttressed by the availability of Terry Kroeger’s outstanding management group at theOmaha World-Herald, a team that has the ability to oversee a large group of papers. The individual papers,however, will be independent in their news coverage and editorial opinions. (I voted for Obama; of our 12 dailiesthat endorsed a presidential candidate, 10 opted for Romney.)Our newspapers are certainly not insulated from the forces that have been driving revenues downward.Still, the six small dailies we owned throughout 2012 had unchanged revenues for the year, a result far superior tothat experienced by big-city dailies. Moreover, the two large papers we operated throughout the year – The Buffalo Newsand theOmaha World-Herald– held their revenue loss to 3%, which was also an above-average outcome.Among newspapers in America’s 50 largest metropolitan areas, our Buffalo and Omaha papers rank near the top incirculation penetration of their home territories.
This popularity is no accident: Credit the editors of those papers – Margaret Sullivan at the Newsand Mike Reilly at theWorld-Herald— for delivering information that has made their publications indispensable tocommunity-interested readers. (Margaret, I regret to say, recently left us to join The New York Times, whose job offers are tough to turn down. That paper made a great hire, and we wish her the best.)
Berkshire’s cash earnings from its papers will almost certainly trend downward over time. Even a sensibleInternet strategy will not be able to prevent modest erosion. At our cost, however, I believe these papers will meetor exceed our economic test for acquisitions. Results to date support that belief.
Charlie and I, however, still operate under economic principle 11 (detailed on page 99) and will notcontinue the operation ofanybusiness doomed to unending losses. One daily paper that we acquired in a bulkpurchase from Media General was significantly unprofitable under that company’s ownership. After analyzing thepaper’s results, we saw no remedy for the losses and reluctantly shut it down. All of our remaining dailies, however,should be profitable for a long time to come. (They are listed on page 108.) At appropriate prices – and thatmeans at averylow multiple of current earnings – we will purchase more papers of the type we like.
************
A milestone in Berkshire’s newspaper operations occurred at yearend when Stan Lipsey retired as publisherofThe Buffalo News. It’s no exaggeration for me to say that theNewsmight now be extinct were it not for Stan. Charlie and I acquired theNewsin April 1977. It was an evening paper, dominant on weekdays but lackinga Sunday edition. Throughout the country, the circulation trend was toward morning papers. Moreover, Sundaywas becoming ever more critical to the profitability of metropolitan dailies. Without a Sunday paper, the Newswas destined to lose out to its morning competitor, which had a fat and entrenched Sunday product.We therefore began to print a Sunday edition late in 1977. And then all hell broke loose. Our competitorsued us, and District Judge Charles Brieant, Jr. authored a harsh ruling that crippled the introduction of our paper.His ruling was later reversed – after 17 long months – in a 3-0 sharp rebuke by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.While the appeal was pending, we lost circulation, hemorrhaged money and stood in constant danger of going out ofbusiness.
Enter Stan Lipsey, a friend of mine from the 1960s, who, with his wife, had sold Berkshire a small Omahaweekly. I found Stan to be an extraordinary newspaperman, knowledgeable about every aspect of circulation,production, sales and editorial. (He was a key person in gaining that small weekly a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.) Sowhen I was in big trouble at theNews, I asked Stan to leave his comfortable way of life in Omaha to take over inBuffalo.He never hesitated. Along with Murray Light, our editor, Stan persevered through four years of very darkdays until theNewswon the competitive struggle in 1982. Ever since, despite a difficult Buffalo economy, theperformance of theNewshas been exceptional. As both a friend and as a manager, Stan is simply the best.
18DividendsA number of Berkshire shareholders – including some of my good friends – would like Berkshire to pay acash dividend. It puzzles them that we relish the dividends we receive from most of the stocks that Berkshire owns,but pay out nothing ourselves. So let’s examine when dividends do and don’t make sense for shareholders.A profitable company can allocate its earnings in various ways (which are not mutually exclusive). Acompany’s management should first examine reinvestment possibilities offered by its current business – projects tobecome more efficient, expand territorially, extend and improve product lines or to otherwise widen the economicmoat separating the company from its competitors.I ask the managers of our subsidiaries to unendingly focus on moat-widening opportunities, and they findmany that make economic sense. But sometimes our managers misfire. The usual cause of failure is that they startwith the answer they want and then work backwards to find a supporting rationale. Of course, the process issubconscious; that’s what makes it so dangerous.Your chairman has not been free of this sin. In Berkshire’s 1986 annual report, I described how twentyyears of management effort and capital improvements in our original textile business were an exercise in futility. Iwantedthe business to succeed andwishedmy way into a series of bad decisions. (I even bought anotherNew England textile company.) But wishing makes dreams come true only in Disney movies; it’s poison in business.
Despite such past miscues, our first priority with available funds will always be to examine whether theycan beintelligentlydeployed in our various businesses. Our record $12.1 billion of fixed-asset investments and bolt-on acquisitions in 2012 demonstrate that this is a fertile field for capital allocation at Berkshire. And here we havean advantage: Because we operate in so many areas of the economy, we enjoy a range of choices far wider than thatopen to most corporations. In deciding what to do, we can water the flowers and skip over the weeds.Even after we deploy hefty amounts of capital in our current operations, Berkshire will regularly generate alot of additional cash. Our next step, therefore, is to search for acquisitions unrelated to our current businesses.Here our test is simple: Do Charlie and I think we can effect a transaction that is likely to leave our shareholderswealthier on a per-share basis than they were prior to the acquisition?
I have made plenty of mistakes in acquisitions and will make more. Overall, however, our record issatisfactory, which means that our shareholders are farwealthier today than they would be if the funds we used for acquisitions had instead been devoted to share repurchases or dividends.But, to use the standard disclaimer, past performance is no guarantee of future results. That’s particularlytrue at Berkshire: Because of our present size, making acquisitions that are both meaningful and sensible is nowmore difficult than it has been during most of our years.Nevertheless, a large deal still offers us possibilities to add materially to per-share intrinsic value. BNSF isa case in point: It is now worth considerably more than our carrying value. Had we instead allocated the fundsrequired for this purchase to dividends or repurchases, you and I would have been worse off. Though largetransactions of the BNSF kind will be rare, there are still some whales in the ocean.The third use of funds – repurchases – is sensible for a company when its shares sell at a meaningfuldiscount to conservatively calculated intrinsic value. Indeed, disciplined repurchases are the surestway to use funds intelligently: It’s hard to go wrong when you’re buying dollar bills for 80¢ or less. We explained our criteria forrepurchases in last year’s report and, if the opportunity presents itself, we will buy large quantities of our stock. Weoriginally said we would not pay more than 110% of book value, but that proved unrealistic. Therefore, weincreased the limit to 120% in December when a large block became available at about 116% of book value.
19But never forget: In repurchase decisions, price is all-important. Value is destroyedwhen purchases are made above intrinsic value. The directors and I believe that continuing shareholders are benefitted in a meaningfulway by purchases up to our 120% limit.And that brings us to dividends. Here we have to make a few assumptions and use some math. Thenumbers will require careful reading, but they are essential to understanding the case for and against dividends. Sobear with me.We’ll start by assuming that you and I are the equal owners of a business with $2 million of net worth. Thebusiness earns 12% on tangible net worth – $240,000 – and can reasonably expect to earn the same 12% onreinvested earnings. Furthermore, there are outsiders who always wish to buy into our business at 125% of networth. Therefore, the value of what we each own is now $1.25 million.
You would like to have the two of us shareholders receive one-third of our company’s annual earnings andhave two-thirds be reinvested. That plan, you feel, will nicely balance your needs for both current income andcapital growth. So you suggest that we pay out $80,000 of current earnings and retain $160,000 to increase thefuture earnings of the business. In the first year, your dividend would be $40,000, and as earnings grew and the one-third payout was maintained, so too would your dividend. In total, dividends and stock value would increase 8%each year (12% earned on net worth less 4% of net worth paid out).
After ten years our company would have a net worth of $4,317,850 (the original $2 million compounded at8%) and your dividend in the upcoming year would be $86,357. Each of us would have shares worth $2,698,656(125% of our half of the company’s net worth). And we would live happily ever after – with dividends and thevalue of our stock continuing to grow at 8% annually.There is an alternative approach, however, that would leave us even happier. Under this scenario, wewould leaveallearnings in the company and each sell 3.2% of our shares annually. Since the shares would be soldat 125% of book value, this approach would produce the same $40,000 of cash initially, a sum that would growannually. Call this option the “sell-off” approach.Under this “sell-off” scenario, the net worth of our company increases to $6,211,696 after ten years($2 million compounded at 12%). Because we would be selling shares each year, our percentageownership would have declined, and, after ten years, we would each own 36.12% of the business. Even so, your share of the networth of the company at that time would be $2,243,540. And, remember, every dollar of net worth attributable toeach of us can be sold for $1.25. Therefore, the market value of your remaining shares would be $2,804,425, about4% greater than the value of your shares if we had followed the dividend approach.Moreover, your annual cash receipts from the sell-off policy would now be running 4% more than youwould have received under the dividend scenario. Voila! – you would have both more cash to spend annually and more capital value.
This calculation, of course, assumes that our hypothetical company can earn an average of 12% annually onnet worth and that its shareholders can sell their shares for an average of 125% of book value. To that point, theS&P 500 earns considerably more than 12% on net worth and sells at a price far above 125% of that net worth.Both assumptions also seem reasonable for Berkshire, though certainly not assured.
Moreover, on the plus side, there also is a possibility that the assumptions will be exceeded. If they are, theargument for the sell-off policy becomes even stronger. Over Berkshire’s history – admittedly one that won’t comeclose to being repeated – the sell-off policy would have produced results for shareholders dramaticallysuperior to the dividend policy.Aside from the favorable math, there are two further – and important– arguments for a sell-off policy. First, dividends impose a specific cash-out policy upon all shareholders. If, say, 40% of earnings is the policy, thosewho wish 30% or 50% will be thwarted. Our 600,000 shareholders cover the waterfront in their desires for cash. Itis safe to say, however, that a great many of them – perhaps even most of them – are in a net-savings mode andlogically should prefer no payment at all.20The sell-off alternative, on the other hand, lets each shareholder make his own choice between cash receiptsand capital build-up. One shareholder can elect to cash out, say, 60% of annual earnings while other shareholderselect 20% or nothing at all. Of course, a shareholder in our dividend-paying scenario could turn around and use hisdividends to purchase more shares. But he would take a beating in doing so: He would both incur taxes and also paya 25% premium to get his dividend reinvested. (Keep remembering, open-market purchases of the stock take placeat 125% of book value.)
The second disadvantage of the dividend approach is of equal importance: The tax consequences for all taxpaying shareholders are inferior – usuallyfarinferior – to those under the sell-off program. Under the dividend program, all of the cash received by shareholders each year is taxed whereas the sell-off program results in tax ononly the gain portion of the cash receipts.Let me end this math exercise – and I can hear you cheering as I put away the dentist drill – by using myown case to illustrate how a shareholder’s regular disposals of shares can be accompanied by an increased investment in his or her business. For the last seven years, I have annually given away about 4
1⁄4%o fm yB e r k s h i r e shares. Through this process, my original position of 712,497,000 B-equivalent shares (split-adjusted) hasdecreased to 528,525,623 shares. Clearly my ownership percentageof the company has significantly decreased.
Yet my investment in the business has actually increased: The book value of my current interest inBerkshire considerably exceeds the book value attributable to my holdings of seven years ago. (The actual figuresare $28.2 billion for 2005 and $40.2 billion for 2012.) In other words, I now have farmore money working for me at Berkshire even though my ownership of the company has materially decreased. It’s also true that my share ofboth Berkshire’s intrinsic business value and the company’s normal earning power is far greater than it was in 2005.Over time, I expect this accretion of value to continue – albeit in a decidedly irregular fashion – even as I nowannually give away more than 4
1⁄2% of my shares (the increase having occurred because I’ve recently doubled mylifetime pledges to certain foundations).
************Above all, dividend policy should always be clear, consistent and rational. A capricious policy willconfuse owners and drive away would-be investors. Phil Fisher put it wonderfully 54 years ago in Chapter 7 of hisCommon Stocks and Uncommon Profits, a book that ranks behind onlyThe Intelligent Investorand the 1940 edition ofSecurity Analysisin the all-time-best list for the serious investor. Phil explained that you can successfully run arestaurant that serves hamburgers or, alternatively, one that features Chinese food. But you can’t switchcapriciously between the two and retain the fans of either.
Most companies pay consistent dividends, generally trying to increase them annually and cutting them veryreluctantly. Our “Big Four” portfolio companies follow this sensible and understandable approach and, in certaincases, also repurchase shares quite aggressively.
We applaud their actions and hope they continue on their present paths. We like increased dividends, andwe love repurchases at appropriate prices.
At Berkshire, however, we have consistently followed a different approach that we know has been sensibleand that we hope has been made understandable by the paragraphs you have just read. We will stick with this policyas long as we believe our assumptions about the book-value buildup and the market-price premium seem reasonable.If the prospects for either factor change materially for the worse, we will reexamine our actions.
The Annual MeetingThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 4
that the CenturyLink Center. Carrie Sova will be in charge. (Though that’s a new name, it’s the same wonderful Carrie as last year; she got married in June to a verylucky guy.) All of our headquarters group pitches in to help her; the whole affair is a homemade production, and Icouldn’t be more proud of those who put it together.21The doors will open at 7 a.m., and at 7:30 we will have our second International Newspaper TossingChallenge. The target will be the porch of a Clayton Home, precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. Last year Isuccessfully fought off all challengers. But now Berkshire has acquired a large number of newspapers and withthem came much tossing talent (or so the throwers claim). Come see whether their talent matches their talk. Betteryet, join in. The papers will be 36 to 42 pages and you must fold them yourself (no rubber bands).At 8:30, a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answerperiod, which (with a break for lunch at the CenturyLink’s stands) will last until 3:30. After a short recess, Charlieand I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decide to leave during the day’s question periods, please do sowhileCharlieis talking.
The best reason to exit, of course, is toshop. We will help you do so by filling the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you did your part, andmost locations racked up record sales. In a nine-hour period, we sold 1,090 pairs of Justin boots, (that’s a pair every30 seconds), 10,010 pounds of See’s candy, 12,879 Quikut knives (24 knives per minute) and 5,784 pairs of WellsLamont gloves, always a hot item. But you can do better. Remember: Anyone who says money can’t buy happinesssimply hasn’t shopped at our meeting.
Last year, Brooks, our running shoe company, exhibited for the first time and ran up sales of $150,000.Brooks is on fire: Its volume in 2012 grew 34%, and that was on top of a similar 34% gain in 2011. The company’smanagement expects another jump of 23% in 2013. We will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer atthe meeting.
On Sunday at 8 a.m., we will initiate the “Berkshire 5K,” a race starting at the CenturyLink. Full details forparticipating will be included in the Visitor’s Guide that you will receive with your credentials for the meeting. Wewill have plenty of categories for competition, including one for the media. (It will be fun to report on their performance.) Regretfully, I will forego running; someonehas to man the starting gun.
I should warn you that we have a lot of home-grown talent. Ted Weschler has run the marathon in 3:01.Jim Weber, Brooks’ dynamic CEO, is another speedster with a 3:31 best. Todd Combs specializes in the triathlon,but has been clocked at 22 minutes in the 5K.
That, however, is just the beginning: Our directors are also fleet of foot (that is, someof our directors are). Steve Burke has run an amazing 2:39 Boston marathon. (It’s a family thing; his wife, Gretchen, finished the NewYork marathon in 3:25.) Charlotte Guyman’s best is 3:37, and Sue Decker crossed the tape in New York in 3:36.Charlie did not return his questionnaire.
GEICO will have a booth in the shopping area, staffed by a number of its top counselors from around thecountry. Stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount (usually 8%).This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental point: Thediscount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that given certain groups.) Bring the details of yourexisting insurance and check out whether we can save you money. For at least half of you, I believe we can.
Be sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry about 35 books and DVDs, including a couple of new ones.Carol Loomis, who has been invaluable to me in editing this letter since 1977, has recently authored Tap Dancing to Work: Warren Buffett on Practically Everything . She and I have cosigned 500 copies, available exclusively at the meeting.
The Outsiders, by William Thorndike, Jr., is an outstanding book about CEOs who excelled at capitalallocation. It has an insightful chapter on our director, Tom Murphy, overall the best business manager I’ve evermet. I also recommendThe Clash of the Culturesby Jack Bogle and Laura Rittenhouse’sInvesting Between the Lines. Should you need to ship your book purchases, a shipping service will be available nearby.TheOmaha World-Heraldwill again have a booth, offering a few books it has recently published. Red-blooded Husker fans – is there any Nebraskan who isn’t one? – will surely want to purchase Unbeatable. It tells the story of Nebraska football during 1993-97, a golden era in which Tom Osborne’s teams went 60-3.22If you are a big spender – or aspire to become one – visit Signature Aviation on the east side of the Omahaairport between noon and 5:00 p.m. on Saturday. There we will have a fleet of NetJets aircraft that will get yourpulse racing. Come by bus; leave by private jet. Live a little.An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain thecredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. Airlines have sometimes jacked up pricesfor the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City versusOmaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2
1⁄2hours, and it may be that you can save significant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. Spend the savings with us.
At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72ndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. Last year the store did $35.9 million of business during itsannual meeting sale, an all-time record that makes other retailers turn green. To obtain the Berkshire discount, youmust make your purchases between Tuesday, April 30
thand Monday, May 6thinclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturersthat normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have madean exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday throughSaturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a picnicto which you are all invited.
At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from6p . m .t o9p . m .o nF r i d a y ,M a y3
rd. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 5th, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. In recent years, our three-day volume has far exceeded sales in all ofDecember, normally a jeweler’s best month.Around 1 p.m. on Sunday, I will begin clerking at Borsheims. Last year my sales totaled $1.5 million.This year I won’t quit until I hit $2 million. Because I need to leave well before sundown, I will be desperate to dobusiness. Come take advantage of me. Ask for my “Crazy Warren” price.
We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 29
ththrough Saturday, May 11th. During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that shows youare a Berkshire holder.On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, willtake on all comers – who will have their eyes wide open – in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, a remarkablemagician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, twoof the world’s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. Don’t playthem for money.
Gorat’s and Piccolo’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 5th. Both will be serving until 10 p.m., with Gorat’s opening at 1 p.m. and Piccolo’s opening at 4 p.m. These restaurants aremy favorites, and I will eat at both of them on Sunday evening. Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call402-551-3733 on April 1
st(but not before) and at Piccolo’s call 402-342-9038. At Piccolo’s, order a giant root beerfloat for dessert. Only sissies get the small one. (I once saw Bill Gates polish off two of the giant variety aftera full-course dinner; that’s when I knew he would make a great director.)
We will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the meeting,asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mailaddresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be emailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC,at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com, and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.
23From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most interestingand important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you keep itconcise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than two questions inany email you send them. (In your email, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if yourquestion is selected.)Last year we had a second panel of three analysts who follow Berkshire. All were insurance specialists,and shareholders subsequently indicated they wanted a little more variety. Therefore, this year we will have oneinsurance analyst, Cliff Gallant of Nomura Securities. Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb will join theanalyst panel to ask questions that deal with our non-insurance operations.
Finally – to spice things up – we would like to add to the panel a credentialed bear on Berkshire, preferablyone who is short the stock. Not yet having a bear identified, we would like to hear from applicants. The onlyrequirement is that you be an investment professional and negative on Berkshire. The three analysts will bring theirown Berkshire-specific questions and alternate with the journalists and the audience in asking them.Charlie and I believe that all shareholders should have access to new Berkshire information simultaneouslyand should also have adequate time to analyze it, which is why we try to issue financial information after the marketclose on a Friday and why our annual meeting is held on Saturdays. We do not talk one-on-one to large institutionalinvestors or analysts. Our hope is that the journalists and analysts will ask questions that will further educateshareholders about their investment.
Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the journalistsand analysts will come up with some tough ones, and that’s the way we like it. All told, we expect at least 54questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and 18 from the audience. If there is some extratime, we will take more from the audience. Audience questioners will be determined by drawings that will takeplace at 8:15 a.m. at each of the 11 microphones located in the arena and main overflow room.************For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-Stars, who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I believe their mindset to beas shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most have no financialneed to work; the joy of hitting business “home runs” means as much to them as their paycheck.Equally important, however, are the 23 men and women who work with me at our corporate office (all onone floor, which is the way we intend to keep it!).
This group efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 21,500-pageFederal income tax return as well as state and foreign returns, responds to countless shareholder and media inquiries,gets out the annual report, prepares for the country’s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board’s activities – andthe list goes on and on.They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easyand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year they dealt with 48 universities(selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They also handle all kinds ofrequests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly dofeel like tap dancing to work every day.
This home office crew, along with our operating managers, has my deepest thanks and deserves yours aswell. Come to Omaha – the cradle of capitalism – on May 4

Notes:Data are for calendar years with these exceptions: 1965 and 1966, year ended 9/30; 1967, 15 months ended12/31. Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold atmarket rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire’sresults through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculatedusing the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-taxwhereas the Berkshire numbers areafter- tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, itsresults would have lagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded theS&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused theaggregate lag to be substantial.
2BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:Berkshire’s gain in net worth during 2013 was $34.2 billion. That gain was afterour deducting $1.8 billion of charges – meaningless economically, as I will explain later – that arose from our purchase of the minorityinterests in Marmon and Iscar. After those charges, the per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stockincreased by 18.2%. Over the last 49 years (that is, since present management took over), book value has grownfrom $19 to $134,973, a rate of 19.7% compounded annually.*On the facing page, we show our long-standing performance measurement: The yearly change inBerkshire’s per-share book value versus the market performance of the S&P 500. What counts, of course, is per-shareintrinsicvalue. But that’s a subjective figure, and book value is useful as a rough tracking indicator. (Anextended discussion of intrinsic value is included in our Owner-Related Business Principles on pages 103 - 108.Those principles have been included in our reports for 30 years, and we urge new and prospective shareholders toread them.)As I’ve long told you, Berkshire’s intrinsic value far exceeds its book value. Moreover, the difference haswidened considerably in recent years. That’s why our 2012 decision to authorize the repurchase of shares at 120%of book value made sense. Purchases at that level benefit continuing shareholders because per-share intrinsic valueexceeds that percentage of book value by a meaningful amount. We did not purchase shares during 2013, however,because the stock price did not descend to the 120% level. If it does, we will be aggressive.Charlie Munger, Berkshire’s vice chairman and my partner, and I believe both Berkshire’s book value andintrinsic value will outperform the S&P in years when the market is down or moderately up. We expect to fallshort, though, in years when the market is strong – as we did in 2013. We have underperformed in ten of our 49years, with all but one of our shortfalls occurring when the S&P gain exceeded 15%.Over the stock market cycle between yearends 2007 and 2013, we overperformed the S&P. Through fullcycles in future years, we expect to do that again. If we fail to do so, we will not have earned our pay. After all, youcould always own an index fund and be assured of S&P results.The Year at BerkshireOn the operating front, just about everything turned out well for us last year – in certain cases verywell. Let me count the ways:
ŠWe completed two large acquisitions, spending almost $18 billion to purchase all of NV Energy and amajor interest in H. J. Heinz. Both companies fit us well and will be prospering a century from now.With the Heinz purchase, moreover, we created a partnership template that may be used by Berkshire infuture acquisitions of size. Here, we teamed up with investors at 3G Capital, a firm led by my friend, JorgePaulo Lemann. His talented associates – Bernardo Hees, Heinz’s new CEO, and Alex Behring, itsChairman – are responsible for operations.
* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are1/1500
thof those shown for A.3Berkshire is the financing partner. In that role, we purchased $8 billion of Heinz preferred stock thatcarries a 9% coupon but also possesses other features that should increase the preferred’s annual return to12% or so. Berkshire and 3G each purchased half of the Heinz common stock for $4.25 billion.Though the Heinz acquisition has some similarities to a “private equity” transaction, there is a crucialdifference: Berkshire never intends to sell a share of the company. What we would like, rather, is to buymore, and that could happen: Certain 3G investors may sell some or all of their shares in the future, andwe might increase our ownership at such times. Berkshire and 3G could also decide at some point that itwould be mutually beneficial if we were to exchange some of our preferred for common shares (at anequity valuation appropriate to the time).Our partnership took control of Heinz in June, and operating results so far are encouraging. Only minorearnings from Heinz, however, are reflected in those we report for Berkshire this year: One-time chargesincurred in the purchase and subsequent restructuring of operations totaled $1.3 billion. Earnings in 2014will be substantial.With Heinz, Berkshire now owns 8
1⁄2companies that, were they stand-alone businesses, would be in theFortune 500. Only 491
1⁄2to go.NV Energy, purchased for $5.6 billion by MidAmerican Energy, our utility subsidiary, supplies electricityto about 88% of Nevada’s population. This acquisition fits nicely into our existing electric-utilityoperation and offers many possibilities for large investments in renewable energy. NV Energy will notbe MidAmerican’s last major acquisition.
ŠMidAmerican is one of our “Powerhouse Five” – a collection of large non-insurance businesses that, inaggregate, had a record $10.8 billion of pre-tax earnings in 2013, up $758 million from 2012. The othercompanies in this sainted group are BNSF, Iscar, Lubrizol and Marmon.Of the five, only MidAmerican, then earning $393 million pre-tax, was owned by Berkshire nine yearsago. Subsequently, we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth,BNSF, we paid about 70% of the cost in cash, and, for the remainder, issued shares that increased thenumber outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $10.4 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshireby the five companies over the nine-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfiesour goal of not simply growing, but rather increasing per-shareresults. If the U.S. economy continues to improve in 2014, we can expect earnings of our Powerhouse Five toimprove also – perhaps by $1 billion or so pre-tax.
ŠOur many dozens of smaller non-insurance businesses earned $4.7 billion pre-tax last year, up from $3.9billion in 2012. Here, too, we expect further gains in 2014.
ŠBerkshire’s extensive insurance operation again operated at an underwriting profit in 2013 – that makes 11years in a row – and increased its float. During that 11-year stretch, our float – money that doesn’t belongto us but that we can invest for Berkshire’s benefit – has grown from $41 billion to $77 billion.Concurrently, our underwriting profit has aggregated $22 billion pre-tax, including $3 billion realized in2013. And all of this all began with our 1967 purchase of National Indemnity for $8.6 million. We now own a wide variety of exceptional insurance operations. Best known is GEICO, the car insurerBerkshire acquired in full at yearend 1995 (having for many years prior owned a partial interest). GEICOin 1996 ranked number seven among U.S. auto insurers. Now, GEICO is number two, having recentlypassed Allstate. The reasons for this amazing growth are simple: low prices and reliable service. You cando yourself a favor by calling 1-800-847-7536 or checking Geico.com to see if you, too, can cut yourinsurance costs. Buy some of Berkshire’s other products with the savings.4ŠWhile Charlie and I search for elephants, our many subsidiaries are regularly making bolt-on acquisitions.Last year, we contracted for 25 of these, scheduled to cost $3.1 billion in aggregate. These transactionsranged from $1.9 million to $1.1 billion in size.Charlie and I encourage these deals. They deploy capital in activities that fit with our existing businessesand that will be managed by our corps of expert managers. The result is no more work for us and moreearnings for you. Many more of these bolt-on deals will be made in future years. In aggregate, they will bemeaningful.
ŠLast year we invested $3.5 billion in the surest sort of bolt-on: the purchase of additional shares in twowonderful businesses that we already controlled. In one case – Marmon – our purchases brought us to the100% ownership we had signed up for in 2008. In the other instance – Iscar – the Wertheimer familyelected to exercise a put option it held, selling us the 20% of the business it retained when we boughtcontrol in 2006.These purchases added about $300 million pre-tax to our current earning power and also delivered us $800million of cash. Meanwhile, the same nonsensical accounting rule that I described in last year’s letterrequired that we enter these purchases on our books at $1.8 billion less than we paid, a process thatreduced Berkshire’s book value. (The charge was made to “capital in excess of par value”; figure thatone out.) This weird accounting, you should understand, instantly increased Berkshire’s excess of intrinsicvalue over book value by the same $1.8 billion.
ŠOur subsidiaries spent a record $11 billion on plant and equipment during 2013, roughly twice ourdepreciation charge. About 89% of that money was spent in the United States. Though we invest abroad aswell, the mother lode of opportunity resides in America.
ŠIn a year in which most equity managers found it impossible to outperform the S&P 500, both ToddCombs and Ted Weschler handily did so. Each now runs a portfolio exceeding $7 billion. They’ve earnedit.I must again confess that their investments outperformed mine. (Charlie says I should add “by a lot.”) Ifsuch humiliating comparisons continue, I’ll have no choice but to cease talking about them.Todd and Ted have also created significant value for you in several matters unrelated to their portfolioactivities. Their contributions are just beginning: Both men have Berkshire blood in their veins.
ŠBerkshire’s yearend employment – counting Heinz – totaled a record 330,745, up 42,283 from last year.The increase, I must admit, included one person at our Omaha home office. (Don’t panic: Theheadquarters gang still fits comfortably on one floor.)
ŠBerkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its “Big Four” investments – AmericanExpress, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. We purchased additional shares of Wells Fargo (increasingour ownership to 9.2% versus 8.7% at yearend 2012) and IBM (6.3% versus 6.0%). Meanwhile, stockrepurchases at Coca-Cola and American Express raised our percentage ownership. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from 8.9% to 9.1% and our interest in American Express from 13.7% to 14.2%. And, if youthink tenths of a percent aren’t important, ponder this math: For the four companies in aggregate, eachincrease of one-tenth of a percent in our share of their equity raises Berkshire’s share of their annualearnings by $50 million.
5The four companies possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented andshareholder-oriented. At Berkshire, we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of awonderful company to owning 100% of a so-so business; it’s better to have a partial interest in the Hopediamond than to own all of a rhinestone.Going by our yearend holdings, our portion of the “Big Four’s” 2013 earnings amounted to $4.4 billion. Inthe earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends we receive – about $1.4 billion lastyear. But make no mistake: The $3 billion of their earnings we don’t report is every bit as valuable to us asthe portion Berkshire records.The earnings that these four companies retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock – a movethat enhances our share of future earnings – as well as for funding business opportunities that usually turnout to be advantageous. All that leads us to expect that the per-share earnings of these four investees willgrow substantially over time. If they do, dividends to Berkshire will increase and, even more important,our unrealized capital gains will, too. (For the four, unrealized gains already totaled $39 billion atyearend.)Our flexibility in capital allocation – our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlledbusinesses – gives us a significant advantage over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they canoperate. Woody Allen stated the general idea when he said: “The advantage of being bi-sexual is that itdoubles your chances for a date on Saturday night.” Similarly, our appetite for eitheroperating businesses or passive investments doubles our chances of finding sensible uses for our endless gusher of cash.************Late in 2009, amidst the gloom of the Great Recession, we agreed to buy BNSF, the largest purchase inBerkshire’s history. At the time, I called the transaction an “all-in wager on the economic future of the UnitedStates.”That kind of commitment was nothing new for us: We’ve been making similar wagers ever since BuffettPartnership Ltd. acquired control of Berkshire in 1965. For good reason, too. Charlie and I have always considereda “bet” on ever-rising U.S. prosperity to be very close to a sure thing.Indeed, who has ever benefited during the past 237 years by betting againstAmerica? If you compare our country’s present condition to that existing in 1776, you have to rub your eyes in wonder. And the dynamismembedded in our market economy will continue to work its magic. America’s best days lie ahead.With this tailwind working for us, Charlie and I hope to build Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic value by(1) constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries; (2) further increasing their earningsthrough bolt-on acquisitions; (3) benefiting from the growth of our investees; (4) repurchasing Berkshire shareswhen they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value; and (5) making an occasional largeacquisition. We will also try to maximize results for youby rarely, if ever, issuing Berkshire shares.Those building blocks rest on a rock-solid foundation. A century hence, BNSF and MidAmerican Energywill still be playing major roles in our economy. Insurance will concomitantly be essential for both businesses andindividuals – and no company brings greater human and financial resources to that business than Berkshire.Moreover, we willalwaysmaintain supreme financial strength, operating with at least $20 billion of cashequivalents and never incurring material amounts of short-term obligations. As we view these and other strengths,Charlie and I like your company’s prospects. We feel fortunate to be entrusted with its management.
6Intrinsic Business ValueAs much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what thatnumber is for Berkshire shares (nor, in fact, for any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid outthe three elements – one of them qualitative – that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire’sintrinsic value. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 109 - 110.Here is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2013 our per-share investments increased 13.6% to$129,253 and our pre-tax earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments increased 12.8% to $9,116per share.Since 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 19.3% compounded annually, and ourearnings figure has grown at a 20.6% clip. It is no coincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the 43-yearperiod has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains inboth sectors, but we will most strongly focus on building operating earnings.************Now, let’s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet andincome characteristics from the others. So we’ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie andI view them (though there are important andenduringadvantages to having them all under one roof). Our goal is to provide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you being thereporting manager and we the absentee shareholders. (But don’t get any ideas!)Insurance“Our investment in the insurance companies reflects a first major step in our efforts to achieve a morediversified base of earning power.”— 1967 Annual ReportLet’s look first at insurance, Berkshire’s core operation and the engine that has consistently propelled ourexpansion since that 1967 report was published.Property-casualty (“P/C”) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, suchas those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go toothers. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their benefit. Though individual policies and claims comeand go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume.Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And howwe have grown, as the following table shows:Year
Float (in $ millions)
1970 $ 391980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322013 77,240Further gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO’s float will almost certainly grow.In National Indemnity’s reinsurance division, however, we have a number of run-off contracts whose float driftsdownward. If we do experience a decline in float at some future time, it will be verygradual – at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can neverbe subject to immediate demands for sums that are large compared to our cash resources. (In this respect, property-casualty insurancediffers in an important way from certain forms of life insurance.)7If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profitthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of freemoney – and, better yet, getpaidfor holding it.Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorousin most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State Farm, by far the country’s largest insurer and awell-managed company besides, incurred an underwriting loss in nine of the twelve years ending in 2012 (the latestyear for which their financials are available, as I write this). Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that theinsurance industry – despite the float income all companies enjoy – will continue its dismal record of earningsubnormal returns as compared to other businesses.As noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for elevenconsecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $22 billion. Looking ahead, I believe we willcontinue to underwrite profitably in most years. Doing so is the daily focus of allof our insurance managers who know that while float is valuable, it can be drowned by poor underwriting results.So how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire’s bookvalue is calculated, thefullamount of our float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to think offloat as strictly a liability is incorrect; it should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claims –some $17 billion to more than five million claimants in 2013 – and that reduces float. Just as surely, we each daywrite new business and thereby generate new claims that add to float. If our revolving float is both costless andlong-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this liability is dramaticallyless than the accounting liability.A counterpart to this overstated liability is $15.5 billion of “goodwill” that is attributable to our insurancecompanies and included in book value as an asset. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paid forthe float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing on its true value. For example, if an insurance business sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwillasset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.Fortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of ourinsurance goodwill – what we would happily pay to purchase an insurance operation possessing float of similar qualityto that we have – to be far in excess of its historic carrying value. The value of our float is one reason – ahuge reason – why we believe Berkshire’s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.************Berkshire’s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers runningdisciplined operations that possess strong, hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risksthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks thatare inappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are farmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe – a loss about triple anything it has ever experienced – Berkshire as a whole would likely record asignificant profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings. And we would remain awash in cash,looking for large opportunities if the catastrophe caused markets to go into shock. All other major insurers andreinsurers would meanwhile be far in the red, with some facing insolvency.From a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $37 billion and a largecumulative underwriting profit, a feat no other insurance CEO has come close to matching. Ajit’s mind is an ideafactory that is always looking for more lines of business he can add to his current assortment.8One venture materialized last June when he formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BHSI”).This initiative took us into commercial insurance, where we were instantly accepted by both major insurancebrokers and corporate risk managers throughout America. These professionals recognize that no other insurer canmatch the financial strength of Berkshire, which guarantees that legitimate claims arising many years in the futurewill be paid promptly and fully.BHSI is led by Peter Eastwood, an experienced underwriter who is widely respected in the insuranceworld. Peter has assembled a spectacular team that is already writing a substantial amount of business with manyFortune 500 companies and with smaller operations as well. BHSI will be a major asset for Berkshire, one that willgenerate volume in the billions within a few years. Give Peter a Berkshire greeting when you see him at the annualmeeting.************We have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all exposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposureactually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit afterboth prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriatepremium can’t be obtained.Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can’t turn their back on businessthat is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, “The other guy is doing it, so we must as well,”spells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance.Tad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re’s hugefloat has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, to continue. We areparticularly enthusiastic about General Re’s international life reinsurance business, which has grown consistentlyand profitably since we acquired the company in 1998.It can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, the company was beset by problems thatcaused commentators – and me as well, briefly – to believe I had made a huge mistake. That day is long gone.General Re is now a gem.************Finally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 63 years ago. GEICO is managed by TonyNicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 52 years of service in 2013. Tony became CEO in 1993, andsince then the company has been flying.
When I was first introduced to GEICO in January 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage thecompany enjoyed compared to the expenses borne by the giants of the industry. That operational efficiency continuestoday and is an all-important asset. No onelikesto buy auto insurance. But almost everyone likes to drive. The insurance needed is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them – and onlya low-cost operation can deliver these.
GEICO’s cost advantage is the factor that has enabled the company to gobble up market share year afteryear. Its low costs create a moat – anenduringone – that competitors are unable to cross. Meanwhile, our little gecko continues to tell Americans how GEICO can save them important money. With our latest reduction inoperating costs, his story has become even more compelling.
9In 1995, we purchased the half of GEICO that we didn’t already own, paying $1.4 billion more than the nettangible assets we acquired. That’s “goodwill,” and it will forever remain unchanged on our books. As GEICO’sbusiness grows, however, so does itstrueeconomic goodwill. I believe that figure to be approaching $20 billion.
************In addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies, most of themplying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world. In aggregate, these companies are a growing operation thatconsistently delivers an underwriting profit. Moreover, as the table below shows, they also provide us withsubstantial float. Charlie and I treasure these companies and their managers. Underwriting Profit

************Simply put, insurance is the sale of promises. The “customer” pays money now; the insurer promises topay money in the future if certain events occur.Sometimes, the promise will not be tested for decades. (Think of life insurance bought by those in their20s.) Therefore, both the ability and willingness of the insurer to pay – even if economic chaos prevails whenpayment time arrives – is all-important.Berkshire’s promises have no equal, a fact affirmed in recent years by the actions of the world’s largestand most sophisticated insurers, some of which have wanted to shed themselves of huge and exceptionally long-lived liabilities, particularly those involving asbestos claims. That is, these insurers wished to “cede” their liabilitiesto a reinsurer. Choosing the wrong reinsurer, however – one that down the road proved to be financially strapped ora bad actor – would put the original insurer in danger of getting the liabilities right back in its lap.Almost without exception, the largest insurers seeking aid came to Berkshire. Indeed, in the largest suchtransaction ever recorded, Lloyd’s in 2007 turned over to us both many thousands of known claims arising frompolicies written before 1993 and an unknown but huge number of claims from that same period sure to materializein the future. (Yes, we will be receiving claims decades from now that apply to events taking place prior to 1993.)Berkshire’s ultimate payments arising from the Lloyd’s transaction are today unknowable. What is certain,however, is that Berkshire will pay all valid claims up to the $15 billion limit of our policy. No other insurer’spromise would have given Lloyd’s the comfort provided by its agreement with Berkshire. The CEO of the entitythen handling Lloyd’s claims said it best: “Names [the original insurers at Lloyd’s] wanted to sleep easy at night,and we think we’ve just bought them the world’s best mattress.”************Berkshire’s great managers, premier financial strength and a variety of business models possessing widemoats form something unique in the insurance world. The combination is a huge asset for Berkshire shareholdersthat will only get more valuable with time.
10Regulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses“Though there are many regulatory restraints in the utility industry, it’s possible that we will makeadditional commitments in the field. If we do, the amounts involved could be large.”— 1999 Annual ReportWe have two major operations, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, that share important characteristicsdistinguishing them from our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section in this letter andsplit out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.A key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, withthese partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact not needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions will far exceedits interest requirements. Last year, for example, BNSF’s interest coverage was 9:1. (Our definition of coverage ispre-tax earnings/interest,notEBITDA/interest, a commonly-used measure we view as seriously flawed.)At MidAmerican, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company’s ability to service its debt under allcircumstances. The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companiesexclusively offering an essential service. The second is enjoyed by few other utilities: a great diversity of earningsstreams, which shield us from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body. Now, with the acquisition ofNV Energy, MidAmerican’s earnings base has further broadened. This particular strength, supplemented byBerkshire’s ownership, has enabled MidAmerican and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower their cost ofdebt. This advantage benefits both usandour customers.Every day, our two subsidiaries power the American economy in major ways:
ŠBNSF carries about 15% (measured by ton-miles) of allinter-city freight, whether it is transported by truck, rail, water, air, or pipeline. Indeed, we move more ton-miles of goods than anyoneelse, a fact establishing BNSF as the most important artery in our economy’s circulatory system. Its hold on thenumber-one position strengthened in 2013.BNSF, like all railroads, also moves its cargo in an extraordinarily fuel-efficient and environmentallyfriendly way, carrying a ton of freight about 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. Trucks taking onthe same job guzzle about four times as much fuel.
ŠMidAmerican’s utilities serve regulated retail customers in eleven states. No utility company stretchesfurther. In addition, we are the leader in renewables: From a standing start nine years ago, MidAmericannow accounts for 7% of the country’s wind generation capacity, with more on the way. Our share insolar – most of which is still in construction – is even larger.MidAmerican can make these investments because it retains allof its earnings. Here’s a little known fact: Last year MidAmerican retained more dollars of earnings – by far – than any other American electricutility. We and our regulators see this as an important advantage – one almost certain to exist five, ten andtwenty years from now.When our current projects are completed, MidAmerican’s renewables portfolio will have cost $15 billion.We relish making such commitments as long as they promise reasonable returns. And, on that front, we put a largeamount of trust in future regulation.
11Our confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will foreverneed massive investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capitalproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is meanwhile in our self-interest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent.Tangible proof of our dedication to that duty was delivered last year in a poll of customer satisfactioncovering 52 holding companies and their 101 operating electric utilities. Our MidAmerican group ranked numberone, with 95.3% of respondents giving us a “very satisfied” vote and not a single customer rating us “dissatisfied.”The bottom score in the survey, incidentally, was a dismal 34.5%.All three of our companies were ranked far lower by this measure before they were acquired byMidAmerican. The extraordinary customer satisfaction we have achieved is of great importance as we expand:Regulators in states we hope to enter are glad to see us, knowing we will be responsible operators.Our railroad has been diligent as well in anticipating the needs of its customers. Whatever you may haveheard about our country’s crumbling infrastructure in no way applies to BNSF or railroads generally. America’s railsystem has never been in better shape, a consequence of huge investments by the industry. We are not, however,resting: BNSF spent $4 billion on the railroad in 2013, double its depreciation charge and a single-year record foranyrailroad. And, we will spend considerably more in 2014. Like Noah, who foresaw early on the need fordependable transportation, we know it’s our job to plan ahead.Leading our two capital-intensive companies are Greg Abel, at MidAmerican, and the team of Matt Roseand Carl Ice at BNSF. The three are extraordinary managers who have my gratitude and deserve yours as well.Here are the key figures for their businesses:MidAmerican (89.8% owned)

In contrast, the operating expense figures above are non-GAAP and exclude some purchase-accountingitems (primarily the amortization of certain intangible assets). We present the data in this manner because Charlieand I believe the adjusted numbers more accurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businessesaggregated in the table than do GAAP figures.
13I won’t explain all of the adjustments – some are tiny and arcane – but serious investors should understandthe disparate nature of intangible assets: Some truly deplete over time while others in no way lose value. Withsoftware, for example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Charges against other intangibles such as theamortization of customer relationships, however, arise through purchase-accounting rules and are clearly not realcosts. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both, that is, are recorded as expenseswhen earnings are calculated – even though from an investor’s viewpoint they could not be more different.In the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 29, amortization charges of $648 million for thecompanies included in this section are deducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these “real,” the rest not.This difference has become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. It will almost certainly risefurther as we acquire more companies.Eventually, of course, the non-real charges disappear when the assets to which they’re related becomefully amortized. But this usually takes 15 years and – alas – it will be my successor whose reported earnings get thebenefit of their expiration.Every dime of depreciation expense we report, however, is a real cost. And that’s true at almost all othercompanies as well. When Wall Streeters tout EBITDA as a valuation guide, button your wallet.Our public reports of earnings will, of course, continue to conform to GAAP. To embrace reality,however, remember to add back most of the amortization charges we report.************The crowd of companies in this section sells products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes. Some ofthese businesses, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangibleassets, enjoy terrific economics, producing profits that run from 25% after-tax to far more than 100%. Others generate good returns in the area of 12% to 20%.A few, however, have very poor returns, a result of some serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation. Iwas not misled: I simply was wrong in my evaluation of the economic dynamics of the company or the industry inwhich it operated.Fortunately, my blunders usually involved relatively small acquisitions. Our large buys have generallyworked out well and, in a few cases, more than well. I have not, however, made my last mistake in purchasingeither businesses or stocks. Not everything works out as planned.Viewed as a single entity, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employed anaverage of $25 billion of net tangible assets during 2013 and, with large quantities of excess cash and littleleverage, earned 16.7% after-tax on that capital.Of course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if the purchase price is excessive.We have paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in thelarge figure we show for goodwill. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we havedeployed in this sector. Furthermore, the intrinsic value of these businesses, in aggregate, exceeds their carryingvalue by a good margin. Even so, the difference between intrinsic value and carrying value in the insurance andregulated-industry segments isfargreater. It is there that the truly big winners reside.************We have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, both currentand potential competitors read this report. In a few of our businesses we might be disadvantaged if they knew ournumbers. So, in some of our operations that are not of a size material to an evaluation of Berkshire, we onlydisclose what is required. You can find a good bit of detail about many of our operations, however, on pages 80-84.
14I can’t resist, however, giving you an update on Nebraska Furniture Mart’s expansion into Texas. I’m notcovering this event because of itseconomicimportance to Berkshire – it takes more than a new store to move theneedle on Berkshire’s $225 billion equity base. But I’ve now worked 30 years with the marvelous Blumkin family,and I’m excited about the remarkable store – truly Texas-sized – it is building at The Colony, in the northern part ofthe Dallas metropolitan area.When the store is completed next year, NFM will have – under one roof, and on a 433-acre site – 1.8 millionsquare feet of retail and supporting warehouse space. View the project’s progress at www.nfm.com/texas. NFMalready owns the two highest-volume home furnishings stores in the country (in Omaha and Kansas City, Kansas),each doing about $450 million annually. I predict the Texas store will blow these records away. If you live anywherenear Dallas, come check us out.I think back to August 30, 1983 – my birthday – when I went to see Mrs. B (Rose Blumkin), carrying a1
1⁄4-page purchase proposal for NFM that I had drafted. (It’s reproduced on pages 114 - 115.) Mrs. B accepted myoffer without changing a word, and we completed the deal without the involvement of investment bankers orlawyers (an experience that can only be described as heavenly). Though the company’s financial statements wereunaudited, I had no worries. Mrs. B simply told me what was what, and her word was good enough for me.Mrs. B was 89 at the time and worked until 103 – definitely my kind of woman. Take a look at NFM’sfinancial statements from 1946 on pages 116 - 117. Everything NFM now owns comes from (a) that $72,264 of networth and $50 –nozeros omitted – of cash the company then possessed, and (b) the incredible talents of Mrs. B,her son, Louie, and his sons Ron and Irv.The punch line to this story is that Mrs. B never spent a day in school. Moreover, she emigrated fromRussia to America knowing not a word of English. But she loved her adopted country: At Mrs. B’s request, thefamily always sangGod Bless Americaat its gatherings.Aspiring business managers should look hard at the plain, but rare, attributes that produced Mrs. B’sincredible success. Students from 40 universities visit me every year, and I have them start the day with a visit toNFM. If they absorb Mrs. B’s lessons, they need none from me.Finance and Financial Products“Clayton’s loan portfolio will likely grow to at least $5 billion in not too many years and, with sensiblecredit standards in place, should deliver significant earnings.”— 2003 Annual ReportThis sector, our smallest, includes two rental companies, XTRA (trailers) and CORT (furniture), as well asClayton Homes, the country’s leading producer and financer of manufactured homes. Aside from these 100%-owned subsidiaries, we also include in this category a collection of financial assets and our 50% interest inBerkadia Commercial Mortgage.Clayton is placed in this section because it owns and services 326,569 mortgages, totaling $13.6 billion. Inrecent years, as manufactured home sales plummeted, a high percentage of Clayton’s earnings came from thismortgage business.In 2013, however, the sale of new homes began to pick up and earnings from both manufacturing andretailing are again becoming significant. Clayton remains America’s number one homebuilder: Its 2013 output of29,547 homes accounted for about 4.7% of all single-family residences built in the country. Kevin Clayton,Clayton’s CEO, has done a magnificent job of guiding the company through the severe housing depression. Now,his job – definitely more fun these days – includes the prospect of another earnings gain in 2014.
15CORT and XTRA are leaders in their industries as well. And Jeff Pederson and Bill Franz will keep themon top. We are backing their plans through purchases of equipment that enlarge their rental potential.Here’s the pre-tax earnings recap for this sector:2013

*This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP “cost” differs in a few cases because ofwrite-ups or write-downs that have been required under its rules.**Excludes shares held by Berkshire subsidiary pension funds.16Berkshire has one major equity position that is not included in the table: We can buy 700 million shares ofBank of America at any time prior to September 2021 for $5 billion. At yearend these shares were worth $10.9billion. We are likely to purchase the shares just before expiration of our option. In the meantime, it is important foryou to realize that Bank of America is, in effect, our fifth largest equity investment and one we value highly.In addition to our equity holdings, we also invest substantial sums in bonds. Usually, we’ve done well inthese. But not always.Most of you have never heard of Energy Future Holdings. Consider yourselves lucky; I certainly wish Ihadn’t. The company was formed in 2007 to effect a giant leveraged buyout of electric utility assets in Texas. Theequity owners put up $8 billion and borrowed a massive amount in addition. About $2 billion of the debt waspurchased by Berkshire, pursuant to a decision I made without consulting with Charlie. That was a bigmistake. Unless natural gas prices soar, EFH will almost certainly file for bankruptcy in 2014. Last year, we soldour holdings for $259 million. While owning the bonds, we received $837 million in cash interest. Overall,therefore, we suffered a pre-tax loss of $873 million. Next time I’ll call Charlie.A few of our subsidiaries – primarily electric and gas utilities – use derivatives in their operations.Otherwise, we have not entered into any derivative contracts for some years, and our existing positions continue torun off. The contracts that have expired have delivered large profits as well as several billion dollars of medium-term float. Though there are no guarantees, we expect a similar result from those remaining on our books.Some Thoughts About InvestingInvestment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike.—The Intelligent Investorby Benjamin GrahamIt is fitting to have a Ben Graham quote open this discussion because I owe so much of what I know aboutinvesting to him. I will talk more about Ben a bit later, and I will even sooner talk about common stocks. But let mefirst tell you about two small non-stock investments that I made long ago. Though neither changed my net worth bymuch, they are instructive.This tale begins in Nebraska. From 1973 to 1981, the Midwest experienced an explosion in farm prices,caused by a widespread belief that runaway inflation was coming and fueled by the lending policies of small ruralbanks. Then the bubble burst, bringing price declines of 50% or more that devastated both leveraged farmers andtheir lenders. Five times as many Iowa and Nebraska banks failed in that bubble’s aftermath than in our recentGreat Recession.In 1986, I purchased a 400-acre farm, located 50 miles north of Omaha, from the FDIC. It cost me$280,000, considerably less than what a failed bank had lent against the farm a few years earlier. I knew nothingabout operating a farm. But I have a son who loves farming and I learned from him both how many bushels of cornand soybeans the farm would produce and what the operating expenses would be. From these estimates, Icalculated the normalized return from the farm to then be about 10%. I also thought it was likely that productivitywould improve over time and that crop prices would move higher as well. Both expectations proved out.I needed no unusual knowledge or intelligence to conclude that the investment had no downside andpotentially had substantial upside. There would, of course, be the occasional bad crop and prices would sometimesdisappoint. But so what? There would be some unusually good years as well, and I would never be under anypressure to sell the property. Now, 28 years later, the farm has tripled its earnings and is worth five times or morewhat I paid. I still know nothing about farming and recently made just my second visit to the farm.
17In 1993, I made another small investment. Larry Silverstein, Salomon’s landlord when I was thecompany’s CEO, told me about a New York retail property adjacent to NYU that the Resolution Trust Corp. wasselling. Again, a bubble had popped – this one involving commercial real estate – and the RTC had been created todispose of the assets of failed savings institutions whose optimistic lending practices had fueled the folly.Here, too, the analysis was simple. As had been the case with the farm, the unleveraged current yield fromthe property was about 10%. But the property had been undermanaged by the RTC, and its income would increasewhen several vacant stores were leased. Even more important, the largest tenant – who occupied around 20% of theproject’s space – was paying rent of about $5 per foot, whereas other tenants averaged $70. The expiration of thisbargain lease in nine years was certain to provide a major boost to earnings. The property’s location was alsosuperb: NYU wasn’t going anywhere.I joined a small group, including Larry and my friend Fred Rose, that purchased the parcel. Fred was anexperienced, high-grade real estate investor who, with his family, would manage the property. And manage it theydid. As old leases expired, earnings tripled. Annual distributions now exceed 35% of our original equityinvestment. Moreover, our original mortgage was refinanced in 1996 and again in 1999, moves that allowed severalspecial distributions totaling more than 150% of what we had invested. I’ve yet to view the property.Income from both the farm and the NYU real estate will probably increase in the decades to come. Thoughthe gains won’t be dramatic, the two investments will be solid and satisfactory holdings for my lifetime and,subsequently, for my children and grandchildren.I tell these tales to illustrate certain fundamentals of investing:
ŠYou don’t need to be an expert in order to achieve satisfactory investment returns. But if you aren’t, youmust recognize your limitations and follow a course certain to work reasonably well. Keep things simpleand don’t swing for the fences. When promised quick profits, respond with a quick “no.”
ŠFocus on the future productivity of the asset you are considering. If you don’t feel comfortable making a roughestimate of the asset’s future earnings, just forget it and move on. No one has the ability to evaluate everyinvestment possibility. But omniscience isn’t necessary; you only need to understand the actions you undertake.
ŠIf you instead focus on the prospective price change of a contemplated purchase, you are speculating.There is nothing improper about that. I know, however, that I am unable to speculate successfully, and Iam skeptical of those who claim sustained success at doing so. Half of all coin-flippers will win their firsttoss;noneof those winners has an expectation of profit if he continues to play the game. And the fact thata given asset has appreciated in the recent past is nevera reason to buy it.
ŠWith my two small investments, I thoughtonlyof what the properties would produce and cared not at allabout their daily valuations. Games are won by players who focus on the playing field – not by thosewhose eyes are glued to the scoreboard. If you can enjoy Saturdays and Sundays without looking at stockprices, give it a try on weekdays.
ŠForming macro opinions or listening to the macro or market predictions of others is a waste of time.Indeed, it is dangerous because it may blur your vision of the facts that are truly important. (When I hearTV commentators glibly opine on what the market will do next, I am reminded of Mickey Mantle’sscathing comment: “You don’t know how easy this game is until you get into that broadcasting booth.”)
18ŠMy two purchases were made in 1986 and 1993. What the economy, interest rates, or the stock marketmight do in the years immediately following – 1987 and 1994 – was of no importance to me in makingthose investments. I can’t remember what the headlines or pundits were saying at the time. Whatever thechatter, corn would keep growing in Nebraska and students would flock to NYU.There is one major difference between my two small investments and an investment in stocks. Stocksprovide you minute-to-minute valuations for your holdings whereas I have yet to see a quotation for either my farmor the New York real estate.It should be an enormous advantage for investors in stocks to have those wildly fluctuating valuationsplaced on their holdings – and for some investors, it is. After all, if a moody fellow with a farm bordering myproperty yelled out a price every day to me at which he would either buy my farm or sell me his – and those pricesvaried widely over short periods of time depending on his mental state – how in the world could I be other thanbenefited by his erratic behavior? If his daily shout-out was ridiculously low, and I had some spare cash, I wouldbuy his farm. If the number he yelled was absurdly high, I could either sell to him or just go on farming.Owners of stocks, however, too often let the capricious and often irrational behavior of their fellow ownerscause them to behave irrationally as well. Because there is so much chatter about markets, the economy, interestrates, price behavior of stocks, etc., some investors believe it is important to listen to pundits – and, worse yet,important to consider acting upon their comments.Those people who can sit quietly for decades when they own a farm or apartment house too often becomefrenetic when they are exposed to a stream of stock quotations and accompanying commentators delivering animplied message of “Don’t just sit there,dosomething.” For these investors, liquidity is transformed from theunqualified benefit it should be to a curse.A “flash crash” or some other extreme market fluctuation can’t hurt an investor any more than an erraticand mouthy neighbor can hurt my farm investment. Indeed, tumbling markets can be helpful to the true investor ifhe has cash available when prices get far out of line with values. A climate of fear is your friendwhen investing; a euphoric world is your enemy.During the extraordinary financial panic that occurred late in 2008, I never gave a thought to selling myfarm or New York real estate, even though a severe recession was clearly brewing. And, if I had owned 100% of asolid business with good long-term prospects, it would have been foolish for me to even consider dumping it. Sowhy would I have sold my stocks that were small participations in wonderful businesses? True, any one of themmight eventually disappoint, but as a group they were certain to do well. Could anyone really believe the earth wasgoing to swallow up the incredible productive assets and unlimited human ingenuity existing in America? ************When Charlie and I buy stocks – which we think of as small portions of businesses – our analysis is verysimilar to that which we use in buying entire businesses. We first have to decide whether we can sensibly estimatean earnings range for five years out, or more. If the answer is yes, we will buy the stock (or business) if it sells at areasonable price in relation to the bottom boundary of our estimate. If, however, we lack the ability to estimatefuture earnings – which is usually the case – we simply move on to other prospects. In the 54 years we have workedtogether, we haveneverforegone an attractive purchase because of the macro or political environment, or the viewsof other people. In fact, these subjects never come up when we make decisions.It’s vital, however, that we recognize the perimeter of our “circle of competence” and stay well inside ofit. Even then, we will make some mistakes, both with stocks and businesses. But they will not be the disasters thatoccur, for example, when a long-rising market induces purchases that are based on anticipated price behavior and adesire to be where the action is.
19Most investors, of course, have not made the study of business prospects a priority in their lives. If wise,they will conclude that they do not know enough about specific businesses to predict their future earning power.I have good news for these non-professionals: The typical investor doesn’t need this skill. In aggregate,American business has done wonderfully over time and will continue to do so (though, most assuredly, inunpredictablefits and starts). In the 20
thCentury, the Dow Jones Industrials index advanced from 66 to 11,497,paying a rising stream of dividends to boot. The 21
stCentury will witness further gains, almost certain to be substantial. The goal of the non-professional should not be to pick winners – neither he nor his “helpers” can dothat – but should rather be to own a cross-section of businesses that in aggregate are bound to do well. A low-costS&P 500 index fund will achieve this goal.That’s the “what” of investing for the non-professional. The “when” is also important. The main danger isthat the timid or beginning investor will enter the market at a time of extreme exuberance and then becomedisillusioned when paper losses occur. (Remember the late Barton Biggs’ observation: “A bull market is like sex. Itfeels best just before it ends.”) The antidote to that kind of mistiming is for an investor to accumulate shares over along period and never to sell when the news is bad and stocks are well off their highs. Following those rules, the“know-nothing” investor who both diversifies and keeps his costs minimalis virtually certain to get satisfactory results. Indeed, the unsophisticated investor who is realistic about his shortcomings is likely to obtain better long-term results than the knowledgeable professional who is blind to even a single weakness.If “investors” frenetically bought and sold farmland to each other, neither the yields nor prices of theircrops would be increased. The only consequence of such behavior would be decreases in the overall earningsrealized by the farm-owning population because of the substantial costs it would incur as it sought advice andswitched properties.Nevertheless, both individuals and institutions will constantly be urged to be active by those who profitfrom giving advice or effecting transactions. The resulting frictional costs can be huge and, for investors inaggregate, devoid of benefit. So ignore the chatter, keep your costs minimal, and invest in stocks as you would in afarm.My money, I should add, is where my mouth is: What I advise here is essentially identical to certaininstructions I’ve laid out in my will. One bequest provides that cash will be delivered to a trustee for my wife’sbenefit. (I have to use cash for individual bequests, because allof my Berkshire shares will be fully distributed to certain philanthropic organizations over the ten years following the closing of my estate.) My advice to the trusteecould not be more simple: Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard’s.) I believe the trust’s long-term results from this policy will be superior tothose attained by most investors – whether pension funds, institutions or individuals – who employ high-feemanagers. ************And now back to Ben Graham. I learned most of the thoughts in this investment discussion from Ben’sbookThe Intelligent Investor, which I bought in 1949. My financial life changed with that purchase.Before reading Ben’s book, I had wandered around the investing landscape, devouring everything writtenon the subject. Much of what I read fascinated me: I tried my hand at charting and at using market indicia to predictstock movements. I sat in brokerage offices watching the tape roll by, and I listened to commentators. All of thiswas fun, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t getting anywhere.In contrast, Ben’s ideas were explained logically in elegant, easy-to-understand prose (without Greekletters or complicated formulas). For me, the key points were laid out in what later editions labeled Chapters 8 and20. (The original 1949 edition numbered its chapters differently.) These points guide my investing decisions today.
20A couple of interesting sidelights about the book: Later editions included a postscript describing anunnamed investment that was a bonanza for Ben. Ben made the purchase in 1948 when he was writing the firstedition and – brace yourself – the mystery company was GEICO. If Ben had not recognized the special qualities ofGEICO when it was still in its infancy, my future and Berkshire’s would have been far different.The 1949 edition of the book also recommended a railroad stock that was then selling for $17 and earningabout $10 per share. (One of the reasons I admired Ben was that he had the guts to use current examples, leavinghimself open to sneers if he stumbled.) In part, that low valuation resulted from an accounting rule of the time thatrequired the railroad to exclude from its reported earnings the substantial retained earnings of affiliates.The recommended stock was Northern Pacific, and its most important affiliate was Chicago, Burlingtonand Quincy. These railroads are now important parts of BNSF (Burlington Northern Santa Fe), which is today fullyowned by Berkshire. When I read the book, Northern Pacific had a market value of about $40 million. Now itssuccessor (having added a great many properties, to be sure) earnsthat amount every four days. I can’t remember what I paid for that first copy of The Intelligent Investor. Whatever the cost, it would underscore the truth of Ben’s adage: Price is what you pay, value is what you get. Of all the investments I evermade, buying Ben’s book was the best (except for my purchase of two marriage licenses). ************Local and state financial problems are accelerating, in large part because public entities promised pensionsthey couldn’t afford. Citizens and public officials typically under-appreciated the gigantic financial tapeworm thatwas born when promises were made that conflicted with a willingness to fund them. Unfortunately, pensionmathematics today remain a mystery to most Americans.Investment policies, as well, play an important role in these problems. In 1975, I wrote a memo toKatharine Graham, then chairman of The Washington Post Company, about the pitfalls of pension promises and theimportance of investment policy. That memo is reproduced on pages 118 - 136.During the next decade, you will read a lot of news – badnews – about public pension plans. I hope my memo is helpful to you in understanding the necessity for prompt remedial action where problems exist.The Annual MeetingThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 3
rdat the CenturyLink Center. Carrie Sova, our talented ringmaster, will be in charge, and all of our headquarters group will pitch in to help her. Our gang both does abetter job than professional event planners would and – yes – saves us money.CenturyLink’s doors will open at 7 a.m., and at 7:30 we will have our third International NewspaperTossing Challenge. Our target will be a Clayton Home porch, precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. I tossedabout 500,000 papers when I was a teenager, so I think I’m pretty good. Challenge me: I’ll buy a Dilly Bar foranyone who lands his or her throw closer to the doorstep than I do. The papers will be 36 to 42 pages, and you mustfold them yourself (no rubber bands allowed).At 8:30, a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answerperiod, which (with a break for lunch at CenturyLink’s stands) will last until 3:30. After a short recess, Charlie andI will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decide to leave during the day’s question periods, please do sowhileCharlieis talking.
21The best reason to exit, of course, is toshop. We’ll assist you by filling the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you did your part, andmost locations racked up record sales. In a nine-hour period, we sold 1,062 pairs of Justin boots (that’s a pair every32 seconds), 12,792 pounds of See’s candy, 11,162 Quikut knives (21 knives per minute) and 6,344 pairs of WellsLamont gloves, always a hot item. This year, Charlie and I will have competing ketchup bottles for sale. Naturally,the one with Charlie’s picture will be heavily discounted. But, if you help, my bottle will outsell his. This isimportant, so don’t let me down.Brooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at the meeting.After you purchase a pair, wear them the next day at our second annual “Berkshire 5K,” an 8 a.m. race starting atthe CenturyLink. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor’s Guide that you will receive withyour tickets for the meeting. Entrants will find themselves running alongside many of Berkshire’s managers,directors and associates.GEICO will have a booth in the shopping area, staffed by a number of its top counselors from around thecountry. Stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount (usually 8%).This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental point: Thediscount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that given certain groups.) Bring the details of yourexisting insurance and check out whether we can save you money. For at least half of you, I believe we can.Be sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry about 35 books and DVDs, among them a couple of newtitles. One is Max Olson’s compilation of Berkshire letters going back to 1965. The book includes an index that Ifind particularly useful, specifying page numbers for individuals, companies and subject matter. I also recommendForty Chancesby my son, Howard. You’ll enjoy it.If you are a big spender – or aspire to become one – visit Signature Flight Support on the east side of theOmaha airport between noon and 5 p.m. on Saturday. There, we will have a fleet of NetJets aircraft sure to set yourpulse racing. Come by bus; leave by private jet. Live a little.An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain thecredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. Airlines have sometimes jacked up pricesfor the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City versusOmaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2
1⁄2hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you significant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. Spend the savings with us.At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72
ndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. Last year in the week surrounding the meeting, the storedid $40.2 million of business, breaking its previous record by 12%. It also set a single day record of $8.2 million onSaturday, selling nearly $1 million of mattresses alone.To obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, April 29

thinclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even applyto the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting butwhich, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation.NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. On Saturday thisyear, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a picnic to which you are all invited.At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May 2
nd. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 4th, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. In recent years, our three-day volume has far exceeded sales in allof December, normally a jeweler’s best month.
22About 1:15 p.m. on Sunday, I will begin clerking at Borsheims. Ask for my “Crazy Warren” quote on theitem of your choice. As I get older, my pricing gets ever more ridiculous. Come take advantage of me.We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 28
ththrough Saturday, May 10th. During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement thatshows you are a Berkshire holder.On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion,will take on all comers – who will have their eyes wide open – in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, aremarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and SharonOsberg, two of the world’s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon.Don’t play them for money.My friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. Lastyear, she made Americans – and especially me – proud with her performance at the Olympics.I met Ariel when she was nine and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Now, she’s afreshman at Princeton and the U.S. Women’s Champion. If you don’t mind embarrassing yourself, test your skillsagainst her, beginning at 1 p.m. Bill Gates and I will lead off and try to soften her up.Gorat’s and Piccolo’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 4
th. Both will be serving until 10 p.m., with Gorat’s opening at 1 p.m. and Piccolo’s opening at 4 p.m. These restaurants aremy favorites, and I will eat at both of them on Sunday evening. Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call402-551-3733 on April 1
st(but not before) and for Piccolo’s call 402-342-9038. At Piccolo’s order a giant root beerfloat for dessert. Only sissies get the small one.We will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at themeeting, asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists andtheir e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be e-mailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com; BeckyQuick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, atarsorkin@nytimes.com.From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most interestingand important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you keep itconcise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than two questions inany e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if yourquestion is selected.)We will also have a panel of three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year the insurance specialist willbe Jay Gelb of Barclays. Questions that deal with our non-insurance operations will come from Jonathan Brandt ofRuane, Cunniff & Goldfarb.And we will again have a credentialed bear on Berkshire. We would like to hear from applicants who areshort Berkshire (please include evidence of your position). The three analysts will bring their own Berkshire-specific questions and alternate with the journalists and the audience in asking them.Charlie and I believe that all shareholders should have access to new Berkshire informationsimultaneously and should also have adequate time to analyze it. That’s why we try to issue financial informationlate on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is held on Saturdays. We do not talk one-on-oneto large institutional investors or analysts, but rather treat allshareholders the same. Our hope is that the journalists and analysts will ask questions that further educate our owners about their investment.
23Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the journalistsand analysts will come up with some tough ones, and that’s the way we like it. All told, we expect at least54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and 18 from the audience. If there is someextra time, we will take more from the audience. Audience questioners will be determined by drawings that willtake place at 8:15 a.m. at each of the 15 microphones located in the arena and main overflow room. ************For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-Stars, who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I believe the mindset of ourmanagers to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Mosthave no financial need to work; the joy of hitting business “home runs” means as much to them as their paycheck.Equally important, however, are the 24 men and women who work with me at our corporate office. Thisgroup efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 23,000-page Federalincome tax return as well as state and foreign returns, responds to countless shareholder and media inquiries, getsout the annual report, prepares for the country’s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board’s activities – and thelist goes on and on.They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easyand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year they dealt with the 40universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They also handleall kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and French fries (smothered inketchup, of course) for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly do feel like tap dancing to work every day.In closing, I think it’s become appropriate to ignore our “no pictures” policy and let you view ourremarkable home-office crew. Below is a photo from our Christmas lunch. Two people couldn’t make it; otherwiseyou are looking at all of those who staff Berkshire’s headquarters. They are truly miracle-workers.Next year’s letter will review our 50 years at Berkshire and speculate a bit about the next 50. In themeantime, come to Omaha on May 3

Starting in 1979,accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market rather than at the lower of cost or market, which waspreviously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire’s results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects , the results are calculated using the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-taxwhereas the Berkshire numbers areafter-tax.I fa corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return. Over theyears, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.
2A note to readers: Fifty years ago, today’s management took charge at Berkshire. For this Golden Anniversary,Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger each wrote his views of what has happened at Berkshire during the past 50years and what each expects during the next 50. Neither changed a word of his commentary after reading what theother had written. Warren’s thoughts begin on page 24 and Charlie’s on page 39. Shareholders, particularly newones, may find it useful to read those letters before reading the report on 2014, which begins below.
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:Berkshire’s gain in net worth during 2014 was $18.3 billion, which increased the per-share book value ofboth our Class A and Class B stock by 8.3%. Over the last 50 years (that is, since present management took over),per-share book value has grown from $19 to $146,186, a rate of 19.4% compounded annually.*During our tenure, we have consistently compared the yearly performance of the S&P 500 to the change inBerkshire’s per-share book value. We’ve done that because book value has been a crude, but useful, tracking device for the number that really counts: intrinsic business value.In our early decades, the relationship between book value and intrinsic value was much closer than it isnow. That was true because Berkshire’s assets were then largely securities whose values were continuously restatedto reflect their current market prices. In Wall Street parlance, most of the assets involved in the calculation of bookvalue were “marked to market.”Today, our emphasis has shifted in a major way to owning and operating large businesses. Many of theseare worth far more than their cost-based carrying value. But that amount is neverrevalued upward no matter how much the value of these companies has increased. Consequently, the gap between Berkshire’s intrinsic value and itsbook value has materially widened.With that in mind, we have added a new set of data – the historical record of Berkshire’s stock price – tothe performance table on the facing page. Market prices, let me stress, have their limitations in the short term.Monthly or yearly movements of stocks are often erratic and not indicative of changes in intrinsic value. Over time,however, stock prices and intrinsic value almost invariably converge. Charlie Munger, Berkshire Vice Chairmanand my partner, and I believe that has been true at Berkshire: In our view, the increase in Berkshire’s per-shareintrinsic value over the past 50 years is roughly equal to the 1,826,163% gain in market price of the company’sshares.
* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500thof those shown for A.3The Year at BerkshireIt was a good year for Berkshire on all major fronts, except one. Here are the important developments:
‹Our “Powerhouse Five” – a collection of Berkshire’s largest non-insurance businesses – had a record $12.4billion of pre-tax earnings in 2014, up $1.6 billion from 2013.* The companies in this sainted group areBerkshire Hathaway Energy (formerly MidAmerican Energy), BNSF, IMC (I’ve called it Iscar in the past),Lubrizol and Marmon.Of the five, only Berkshire Hathaway Energy, then earning $393 million, was owned by us a decade ago.Subsequently we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth, BNSF, wepaid about 70% of the cost in cash and, for the remainder, issued Berkshire shares that increased thenumber outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $12 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshire bythe five companies over the ten-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfies ourgoal of not simply increasing earnings, but making sure we also increase per-shareresults. If the U.S. economy continues to improve in 2015, we expect earnings of our Powerhouse Five to improveas well. The gain could reach $1 billion, in part because of bolt-on acquisitions by the group that havealready closed or are under contract.
‹Our bad news from 2014 comes from our group of five as well and is unrelated to earnings. During theyear, BNSF disappointed many of its customers. These shippers depend on us, and service failures canbadly hurt their businesses.BNSF is, by far, Berkshire’s most important non-insurance subsidiary and, to improve its performance, wewill spend $6 billion on plant and equipment in 2015. That sum is nearly 50% more than any other railroadhas spent in a single year and is a truly extraordinary amount, whether compared to revenues, earnings ordepreciation charges.Though weather, which was particularly severe last year, will always cause railroads a variety of operatingproblems, our responsibility is to dowhatever it takesto restore our service to industry-leading levels. That can’t be done overnight: The extensive work required to increase system capacity sometimes disruptsoperations while it is underway. Recently, however, our outsized expenditures are beginning to showresults. During the last three months, BNSF’s performance metrics have materially improved from lastyear’s figures.
‹Our many dozens of smaller non-insurance businesses earned $5.1 billion last year, up from $4.7 billion in2013. Here, as with our Powerhouse Five, we expect further gains in 2015. Within this group, we have twocompanies that last year earned between $400 million and $600 million, six that earned between $250million and $400 million, and seven that earned between $100 million and $250 million. This collection ofbusinesses will increase in both number and earnings. Our ambitions have no finish line.
‹Berkshire’s huge and growing insurance operation again operated at an underwriting profit in 2014 – thatmakes 12 years in a row – and increased its float. During that 12-year stretch, our float – money thatdoesn’t belong to us but that we can invest for Berkshire’s benefit – has grown from $41 billion to $84billion. Though neither that gain nor the size of our float is reflected in Berkshire’s earnings, floatgenerates significant investment income because of the assets it allows us to hold.* Throughout this letter, as well as in the “Golden Anniversary” letters included later in this report, all earnings arestated on a pre-tax basis unless otherwise designated.4Meanwhile, our underwriting profit totaled $24 billion during the twelve-year period, including $2.7 billionearned in 2014. And all of this began with our 1967 purchase of National Indemnity for $8.6 million.
‹While Charlie and I search for new businesses to buy, our many subsidiaries are regularly making bolt-onacquisitions. Last year was particularly fruitful: We contracted for 31 bolt-ons, scheduled to cost $7.8billion in aggregate. The size of these transactions ranged from $400,000 to $2.9 billion. However, thelargest acquisition, Duracell, will not close until the second half of this year. It will then be placed underMarmon’s jurisdiction.Charlie and I encourage bolt-ons,ifthey are sensibly-priced. (Most deals offered us aren’t.) They deploycapital in activities that fit with our existing businesses and that will be managed by our corps of expertmanagers. This means no more work for us, yet more earnings, a combination we find particularlyappealing. We will make many more of these bolt-on deals in future years.
‹Two years ago my friend, Jorge Paulo Lemann, asked Berkshire to join his 3G Capital group in theacquisition of Heinz. My affirmative response was a no-brainer: I knew immediately that this partnershipwould work well from both a personal and financial standpoint. And it most definitely has.I’m not embarrassed to admit that Heinz is run far better under Alex Behring, Chairman, and BernardoHees, CEO, than would be the case if I were in charge. They hold themselves to extraordinarily highperformance standards and are never satisfied, even when their results far exceed those of competitors.We expect to partner with 3G in more activities. Sometimes our participation will only involve a financingrole, as was the case in the recent acquisition of Tim Hortons by Burger King. Our favored arrangement,however, will usually be to link up as apermanentequity partner (who, in some cases, contributes to the financing of the deal as well). Whatever the structure, we feel good when working with Jorge Paulo.Berkshire also has fine partnerships with Mars and Leucadia, and we may form new ones with them or withother partners. Our participation in any joint activities, whether as a financing or equity partner, will belimited to friendly transactions.
‹In October, we contracted to buy Van Tuyl Automotive, a group of 78 automobile dealerships that isexceptionally well-run. Larry Van Tuyl, the company’s owner, and I met some years ago. He then decidedthat if he were ever to sell his company, its home should be Berkshire. Our purchase was recentlycompleted, and we are now “car guys.”Larry and his dad, Cecil, spent 62 years building the group, following a strategy that made owner-partnersof all local managers. Creating this mutuality of interests proved over and over to be a winner. Van Tuyl isnow the fifth-largest automotive group in the country, with per-dealership sales figures that areoutstanding.In recent years, Jeff Rachor has worked alongside Larry, a successful arrangement that will continue. Thereare about 17,000 dealerships in the country, and ownership transfers always require approval by therelevant auto manufacturer. Berkshire’s job is to perform in a manner that will cause manufacturers towelcome further purchases by us. If we do this – and if we can buy dealerships at sensible prices – we willbuild a business that before long will be multiples the size of Van Tuyl’s $9 billion of sales.With the acquisition of Van Tuyl, Berkshire now owns 9
1⁄2companies that would be listed on the Fortune 500 were they independent (Heinz is the
1⁄2). That leaves 4901⁄2fish in the sea. Our lines are out.
5‹Our subsidiaries spent a record $15 billion on plant and equipment during 2014, well over twice theirdepreciation charges. About 90% of that money was spent in the United States. Though we will alwaysinvest abroad as well, the mother lode of opportunities runs through America. The treasures that have beenuncovered up to now are dwarfed by those still untapped. Through dumb luck, Charlie and I were born inthe United States, and we are forever grateful for the staggering advantages this accident of birth has givenus.
‹Berkshire’s yearend employees – including those at Heinz – totaled a record 340,499, up 9,754 from lastyear. The increase, I am proud to say, included no gain at headquarters (where 25 people work). No sensegoing crazy.
‹Berkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its “Big Four” investments – AmericanExpress, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. We purchased additional shares of IBM (increasing ourownership to 7.8% versus 6.3% at yearend 2013). Meanwhile, stock repurchases at Coca-Cola, AmericanExpress and Wells Fargo raised our percentage ownership of each. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from9.1% to 9.2%, our interest in American Express increased from 14.2% to 14.8% and our ownership ofWells Fargo grew from 9.2% to 9.4%. And, if you think tenths of a percent aren’t important, ponder thismath: For the four companies in aggregate, each increase of one-tenth of a percent in our ownership raisesBerkshire’s portion of their annual earnings by $50 million.These four investees possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented andshareholder-oriented. At Berkshire, we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of awonderful company to owning 100% of a so-so business. It’s better to have a partial interest in the HopeDiamond than to own all of a rhinestone.If Berkshire’s yearend holdings are used as the marker, our portion of the “Big Four’s” 2014 earningsbefore discontinued operations amounted to $4.7 billion (compared to $3.3 billion only three years ago). Inthe earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends we receive – about $1.6 billion lastyear. (Again, three years ago the dividends were $862 million.) But make no mistake: The $3.1 billion ofthese companies’ earnings we don’t report are every bit as valuable to us as the portion Berkshire records.The earnings these investees retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock – a move thatenhances Berkshire’s share of future earnings without requiring us to lay out a dime. Their retainedearnings also fund business opportunities that usually turn out to be advantageous. All that leads us toexpect that the per-share earnings of these four investees, in aggregate, will grow substantially over time(though 2015 will be a tough year for the group, in part because of the strong dollar). If the expected gainsmaterialize, dividends to Berkshire will increase and, even more important, so will our unrealized capitalgains. (For the package of four, our unrealized gains already totaled $42 billion at yearend.)Our flexibility in capital allocation – our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlledbusinesses – gives us a significant advantage over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they canoperate. Our appetite foreitheroperating businesses or passive investments doubles our chances of findingsensible uses for Berkshire’s endless gusher of cash.
‹I’ve mentioned in the past that my experience in business helps me as an investor and that my investmentexperience has made me a better businessman. Each pursuit teaches lessons that are applicable to the other.And some truths can only be fully learned through experience. (In Fred Schwed’s wonderful book, Where Are the Customers’ Yachts?, a Peter Arno cartoon depicts a puzzled Adam looking at an eager Eve, while acaption says, “There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin either by words orpictures.” If you haven’t read Schwed’s book, buy a copy at our annual meeting. Its wisdom and humor aretruly priceless.)
6Among Arno’s “certain things,” I would include two separate skills, the evaluation of investments and themanagement of businesses. I therefore think it’s worthwhile for Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, our twoinvestment managers, to each have oversight of at least one of our businesses. A sensible opportunity forthem to do so opened up a few months ago when we agreed to purchase two companies that, thoughsmaller than we would normally acquire, have excellent economic characteristics. Combined, the two earn$100 million annually on about $125 million of net tangible assets.I’ve asked Todd and Ted to each take on one as Chairman, in which role they will function in the verylimited way that I do with our larger subsidiaries. This arrangement will save me a minor amount of workand, more important, make the two of them even better investors than they already are (which is to sayamong the best).************Late in 2009, amidst the gloom of the Great Recession, we agreed to buy BNSF, the largest purchase inBerkshire’s history. At the time, I called the transaction an “all-in wager on the economic future of the UnitedStates.”That kind of commitment was nothing new for us. We’ve been making similar wagers ever since BuffettPartnership Ltd. acquired control of Berkshire in 1965. For good reason, too: Charlie and I have always considered a“bet” on ever-rising U.S. prosperity to be very close to a sure thing.Indeed, who has ever benefited during the past 238 years by betting againstAmerica? If you compare our country’s present condition to that existing in 1776, you have to rub your eyes in wonder. In my lifetime alone, real per-capita U.S. output hassextupled. My parents could not have dreamed in 1930 of the world their son would see.Though the preachers of pessimism prattle endlessly about America’s problems, I’ve never seen one who wishes toemigrate (though I can think of a few for whom I would happily buy a one-way ticket).The dynamism embedded in our market economy will continue to work its magic. Gains won’t come in asmooth or uninterrupted manner; they never have. And we will regularly grumble about our government. But, mostassuredly, America’s best days lie ahead.With this tailwind working for us, Charlie and I hope to build Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic value by(1) constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries; (2) further increasing their earningsthrough bolt-on acquisitions; (3) benefiting from the growth of our investees; (4) repurchasing Berkshire shareswhen they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value; and (5) making an occasional largeacquisition. We will also try to maximize results for youby rarely, if ever, issuing Berkshire shares.Those building blocks rest on a rock-solid foundation. A century hence, BNSF and Berkshire HathawayEnergy will still be playing vital roles in our economy. Homes and autos will remain central to the lives of mostfamilies. Insurance will continue to be essential for both businesses and individuals. Looking ahead, Charlie and Isee a world made to order for Berkshire. We feel fortunate to be entrusted with its management.Intrinsic Business ValueAs much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what thatnumber is for Berkshire shares (nor, in fact, for any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid out thethree elements – one of them qualitative – that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire’s intrinsicvalue. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 123-124.Here is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2014 our per-share investments increased 8.4% to$140,123, and our earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments increased 19% to $10,847 pershare.
7Since 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 19% compounded annually, and ourearnings figure has grown at a 20.6% clip. It is no coincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the ensuing 44years has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains in bothsectors, but our main focus is to build operating earnings. That’s why we were pleased to exchange our Phillips 66and Graham Holdings stock for operating businesses last year and to contract with Procter and Gamble to acquireDuracell by means of a similar exchange set to close in 2015.************Now, let’s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet andincome characteristics from the others. So we’ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie andI view them (though there are important andenduringadvantages to having them all under one roof). Our goal is to provide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you being thereporting manager and we the absentee shareholders. (But don’t get any ideas!)InsuranceLet’s look first at insurance, Berkshire’s core operation. That industry has been the engine that haspropelled our expansion since 1967, when we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire &Marine, for $8.6 million. Though that purchase had monumental consequences for Berkshire, its execution wassimplicity itself.Jack Ringwalt, a friend of mine who was the controlling shareholder of the two companies, came to myoffice saying he would like to sell. Fifteen minutes later, we had a deal. Neither of Jack’s companies had ever had anaudit by a public accounting firm, and I didn’t ask for one. My reasoning: (1) Jack was honest and (2) He was also abit quirky and likely to walk away if the deal became at all complicated.On pages 128-129, we reproduce the 1
1⁄2-page purchase agreement we used to finalize the transaction. That contract was homemade: Neither side used a lawyer. Per page, this has to be Berkshire’s best deal: NationalIndemnity today has GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net worth of $111 billion, which exceeds thatof any other insurer in the world.One reason we were attracted to the property-casualty business was its financial characteristics: P/Cinsurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certainworkers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later modelleaves P/C companies holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile,insurers get to invest this float for their benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount offloat an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our businessgrows, so does our float. Andhowwe have grown, as the following table shows:Year
Float (in $ millions)
1970 $ 391980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322014 83,921Further gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO and our new commercialinsurance operation are almost certain to grow at a good clip. National Indemnity’s reinsurance division, however, isparty to a number of run-off contracts whose float drifts downward. If we do in time experience a decline in float, itwill beverygradual – at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such thatwe canneverbe subject to immediate demands for sums that are large compared to our cash resources. This strengthis a key pillar in Berkshire’s economic fortress.8If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profitthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money– and, better yet, getpaidfor holding it.Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, sovigorous indeed that it frequently causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that theinsurance industry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earningsubnormal returns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses. The prolonged period of lowinterest rates our country is now dealing with causes earnings on float to decrease, thereby exacerbating the profitproblems of the industry.As noted in the first section of this report, Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit fortwelve consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $24 billion. Looking ahead, I believe wewill continue to underwrite profitably in most years. Doing so is the daily focus of allof our insurance managers, who know that while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned by poor underwriting results. That message isgiven at least lip service by all insurers; at Berkshire it is a religion.So how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire’s bookvalue is calculated, thefullamount of our float is deducted as aliability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to thinkof float as strictly a liability is incorrect; it should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claimsand related expenses – a huge $22.7 billion to more than six million claimants in 2014 – and that reduces float. Justas surely, we each day write new business and thereby generate new claims that add to float.If our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of thisliability isdramaticallyless than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises –because new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute – is worlds different from owing $1 that will go out thedoor tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities are treated as equals, however, under GAAP.A partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion “goodwill” asset that we incurred in buyingour insurance companies and that increases book value. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paidfor the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing on its true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.Fortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of ourinsurance goodwill – what we would happily pay for float of similar qualitywere we to purchase an insurance operation possessing it – to befarin excess of its historic carrying value. Under present accounting rules (withwhich we agree) this excess value willneverbe entered on our books. But I can assure you that it’s real. That’s onereason – a huge reason – why we believe Berkshire’s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.************Berkshire’s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers runningdisciplined operations that possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risksthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks thatare inappropriate in relation to our resources.
9Indeed, we arefarmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if theinsurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe – a loss about triple anythingit has ever experienced – Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of itsmany streams of earnings. We would also remain awash in cash and be looking for large opportunities in a marketthat might well have gone into shock. Meanwhile, other major insurers and reinsurers would be far in the red, if notfacing insolvency.Ajit’s underwriting skills are unmatched. His mind, moreover, is an idea factory that is always lookingfor more lines of business he can add to his current assortment. Last year I told you about his formation of BerkshireHathaway Specialty Insurance (“BHSI”). This initiative took us into commercial insurance, where we were instantlywelcomed by both major insurance brokers and corporate risk managers throughout America. Previously, we hadwritten only a few specialized lines of commercial insurance.BHSI is led by Peter Eastwood, an experienced underwriter who is widely respected in the insuranceworld. During 2014, Peter expanded his talented group, moving into both international business and new lines ofinsurance. We repeat last year’s prediction that BHSI will be a major asset for Berkshire, one that will generatevolume in the billions within a few years.************We have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all exposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actuallycausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after bothprospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriatepremium can’t be obtained.Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can’t turn their back on businessthat is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, “The other guy is doing it, so we must as well,”spells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance.Tad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re’s hugefloat has been considerably better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, to continue.We are particularly enthusiastic about General Re’s international life reinsurance business, which has grownconsistently and profitably since we acquired the company in 1998.It can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, it was beset by problems that causedcommentators – and me as well, briefly – to believe I had made a huge mistake. That day is long gone. General Reis now a gem.************Finally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 64 years ago. GEICO is managed by TonyNicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 53 years of service in 2014. Tony became CEO in 1993, andsince then the company has been flying. There is nobetter manager than Tony.When I was first introduced to GEICO in January 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage thecompany enjoyed compared to the expenses borne by the giants of the industry. It was clear to me that GEICOwould succeed because itdeservedto succeed. No onelikesto buy auto insurance. Almost everyone, though, likes to drive. The insurance consequently needed is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them – andonlya low-cost operation can deliver these. Indeed, at least 40% of the people reading this letter can save money byinsuring with GEICO. So stop reading and go to geico.com or call 800-368-2734.10GEICO’s cost advantage is the factor that has enabled the company to gobble up market share year afteryear. (We ended 2014 at 10.8% compared to 2.5% in 1995, when Berkshire acquired control of GEICO.) Thecompany’s low costs create a moat – anenduringone – that competitors are unable to cross. Our gecko never tires of telling Americans how GEICO can save them important money. The gecko, I should add, has one particularlyendearing quality – he works without pay. Unlike a human spokesperson, he never gets a swelled head from hisfame nor does he have an agent to constantly remind us how valuable he is. I love the little guy.************In addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies, most of themplying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world. In aggregate, these companies are a growing operation thatconsistently delivers an underwriting profit. Indeed, over the past decade, they have earned $2.95 billion fromunderwriting while growing their float from $1.7 billion to $8.6 billion. Charlie and I treasure these companies andtheir managers.

************Simply put, insurance is the sale of promises. The “customer” pays money now; the insurer promises topay money in the future should certain unwanted events occur.Sometimes, the promise will not be tested for decades. (Think of life insurance bought by people in their20s.) Therefore, both the ability and willingness of the insurer to pay, even if economic chaos prevails whenpayment time arrives, is all-important.Berkshire’s promises have no equal, a fact affirmed in recent years by certain of the world’s largest andmost sophisticated P/C insurers, who wished to shed themselves of huge and exceptionally long-lived liabilities.That is, these insurers wished to “cede” these liabilities – most of them potential losses from asbestos claims – to areinsurer. They needed the right one, though: If a reinsurer fails to pay a loss, the original insurer is still on the hookfor it. Choosing a reinsurer, therefore, that down the road proves to be financially strapped or a bad actor threatensthe original insurer with getting huge liabilities right back in its lap.Last year, our premier position in reinsurance was reaffirmed by our writing a policy carrying a $3 billionsingle premium. I believe that the policy’s size has only been exceeded by our 2007 transaction with Lloyd’s, inwhich the premium was $7.1 billion.In fact, I know of only eight P/C policies in history that had a single premium exceeding $1 billion. And,yes, all eight were written by Berkshire. Certain of these contracts will require us to make substantial payments 50years or more from now. When major insurers have needed an unquestionable promise that payments of this typewill be made, Berkshire has been the party – the onlyparty – to call.************Berkshire’s great managers, premier financial strength and a variety of business models protected bywide moats amount to something unique in the insurance world. This assemblage of strengths is a huge asset forBerkshire shareholders that will only get more valuable with time.11Regulated, Capital-Intensive BusinessesWe have two major operations, BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”), that share importantcharacteristics distinguishing them from our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section inthis letter and split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.A key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, withthese partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact not needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions will far exceedits interest requirements. Last year, for example, BNSF’s interest coverage was more than 8:1. (Our definition ofcoverage is pre-tax earnings/interest,notEBITDA/interest, a commonly used measure we view as seriously flawed.)At BHE, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company’s ability to service its debt under all circumstances.The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companies offering anessential service on an exclusive basis. The second is enjoyed by few other utilities: a great diversity of earningsstreams, which shield us from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body. Recently, we have furtherbroadened that base through our $3 billion (Canadian) acquisition of AltaLink, an electric transmission systemserving 85% of Alberta’s population. This multitude of profit streams, supplemented by the inherent advantage ofbeing owned by a strong parent, has enabled BHE and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower their cost of debt.This economic fact benefits both usandour customers.Every day, our two subsidiaries power the American economy in major ways: BNSF carries about 15% (measured by ton-miles) of allinter-city freight, whether it is transported by truck, rail, water, air, or pipeline. Indeed, we move more ton-miles of goods than anyoneelse, a fact establishing BNSF as the most important artery in our economy’s circulatory system.BNSF, like all railroads, also moves its cargo in an extraordinarily fuel-efficient and environmentallyfriendly way, carrying a ton of freight about 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. Trucks taking onthe same job guzzle about four times as much fuel. BHE’s utilities serve regulated retail customers in eleven states. No utility company stretches further. Inaddition, we are a leader in renewables: From a standing start ten years ago, BHE now accounts for 6% ofthe country’s wind generation capacity and 7% of its solar generation capacity. Beyond these businesses,BHE owns two large pipelines that deliver 8% of our country’s natural gas consumption; the recently-purchased electric transmission operation in Canada; and major electric businesses in the U.K. andPhilippines. And the beat goes on: We will continue to buy and build utility operations throughout theworld for decades to come.BHE can make these investments because it retains allof its earnings. In fact, last year the company retained more dollars of earnings – by far – than any other American electric utility. We and ourregulators see this 100% retention policy as an important advantage – one almost certain to distinguishBHE from other utilities for many years to come.When BHE completes certain renewables projects that are underway, the company’s renewables portfoliowill have cost $15 billion. In addition, we have conventional projects in the works that will also cost many billions.We relish making such commitments as long as they promise reasonable returns – and, on that front, we put a largeamount of trust in future regulation.Our confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will foreverneed massive investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capitalproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is concomitantly in ourself-interest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people theyrepresent.12Last year we fully met this objective at BHE, just as we have in every year of our ownership. Our ratesremain low, our customer satisfaction is high and our record for employee safety is among the best in the industry.The story at BNSF, however – as I noted earlier – was not good in 2014, a year in which the railroaddisappointed many of its customers. This problem occurred despite the record capital expenditures that BNSF hasmade in recent years, with those having far exceeded the outlays made by Union Pacific, our principal competitor.The two railroads are of roughly equal size measured by revenues, though we carry considerably morefreight (measured either by carloads or ton-miles). But our service problems exceeded Union Pacific’s last year, andwe lost market share as a result. Moreover, U.P.’s earnings beat ours by a record amount. Clearly, we have a lot ofwork to do.We are wasting no time: As I also mentioned earlier, we will spend $6 billion in 2015 on improving ourrailroad’s operation. That will amount to about 26% of estimated revenues (a calculation that serves as theindustry’s yardstick). Outlays of this magnitude are largely unheard of among railroads. For us, this percentagecompares to our average of 18% in 2009-2013 and to U.P.’s projection for the near future of 16-17%. Our hugeinvestments will soon lead to a system with greater capacity and much better service. Improved profits shouldfollow.Here are the key figures for Berkshire Hathaway Energy and BNSF:Berkshire Hathaway Energy (89.9% owned)

*Earnings for 2012 and 2013 have been restated to exclude Marmon’s leasing operations, which are now included inthe Finance and Financial Products section.Our income and expense data conforming to GAAP is on page 49. In contrast, the operating expensefigures above are non-GAAP and exclude some purchase-accounting items (primarily the amortization of certainintangible assets). We present the data in this manner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbers moreaccurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businesses aggregated in the table than do GAAPfigures.I won’t explain all of the adjustments – some are tiny and arcane – but serious investors should understandthe disparate nature of intangible assets. Some truly deplete over time, while others in no waylose value. For software, as a big example, amortization charges are very real expenses. The concept of making charges againstother intangibles, such as the amortization of customer relationships, however, arises through purchase-accountingrules and clearly does not reflect reality. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges.Both, that is, are recorded as expenses when earnings are calculated – even though from an investor’s viewpointthey could not be more different.
14In the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 49, amortization charges of $1.15 billion have beendeducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these “real,” the rest not. The “non-real” charges, once non-existent at Berkshire, have become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. Non-realamortization charges will almost certainly rise further as we acquire more companies.
The GAAP-compliant table on page 67 gives you the current status of our intangible assets. We now have$7.4 billion left to amortize, of which $4.1 billion will be charged over the next five years. Eventually, of course,every dollar of non-real costs becomes entirely charged off. When that happens, reported earnings increase even iftrue earnings are flat.Depreciation charges, we want to emphasize, are different: Every dime of depreciation expense we reportis a real cost. That’s true, moreover, at most other companies. When CEOs tout EBITDA as a valuation guide, wirethem up for a polygraph test.Our public reports of earnings will, of course, continue to conform to GAAP. To embrace reality, however,you should remember to add back most of the amortization charges we report.************To get back to our many manufacturing, service and retailing operations, they sell products ranging fromlollipops to jet airplanes. Some of this sector’s businesses, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangibleassets, enjoy terrific economics, producing profits that run from 25% after-tax to far more than 100%. Others generate goodreturns in the area of 12% to 20%. A few, however, have very poor returns, the result of some serious mistakes Imade in my job of capital allocation. I was not misled: I simply was wrong in my evaluation of the economicdynamics of the company or the industry in which it operates.Fortunately, my blunders normally involved relatively small acquisitions. Our large buys have generallyworked out well and, in a few cases, more than well. I have not, nonetheless, made my last mistake in purchasingeither businesses or stocks. Not everything works out as planned.Viewed as a single entity, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employed an averageof $24 billion of net tangible assets during 2014 and, despite their holding large quantities of excess cash and usinglittle leverage, earned 18.7% after-tax on that capital.Of course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if it is bought for too high a price. Wehave paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the largefigure we show for goodwill. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we have deployed inthis sector. Furthermore, the intrinsic value of these businesses, in aggregate, exceeds their carrying value by a goodmargin, and that premium is likely to widen. Even so, the difference between intrinsic value and carrying value inboth the insurance and regulated-industry segments is fargreater. It is there that the truly big winners reside.************We have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, theircompetitors – both current and potential – read this report. In a few of our businesses we might be disadvantaged ifothers knew our numbers. In some of our operations that are not of a size material to an evaluation of Berkshire,therefore, we only disclose what is required. You can find a good bit of detail about many of our operations,however, on pages 97-100.
15Finance and Financial ProductsThis year we include in this section Marmon’s very sizable leasing operations, whose wares are railcars,containers and cranes. We have also restated the previous two years to reflect that change. Why have we made it? Atone time there was a large minority ownership at Marmon, and I felt it was more understandable to include all of thecompany’s operations in one place. Today we own virtually 100% of Marmon, which makes me think you will gainmore insight into our various businesses if we include Marmon’s leasing operations under this heading. (The figuresfor the many dozens of Marmon’s other businesses remain in the previous section.)Our other leasing and rental operations are conducted by CORT (furniture) and XTRA (semi-trailers).These companies are industry leaders and have substantially increased their earnings as the American economy hasgained strength. Both companies have invested more money in new equipment than have many of their competitors,and that’s paying off.Kevin Clayton has again delivered an industry-leading performance at Clayton Homes, the largest homebuilder in America. Last year, Clayton sold 30,871 homes, about 45% of the manufactured homes bought byAmericans. When we purchased Clayton in 2003 for $1.7 billion, its share was 14%.Key to Clayton’s earnings is the company’s $13 billion mortgage portfolio. During the financial panic of2008 and 2009, when funding for the industry dried up, Clayton was able to keep lending because of Berkshire’sbacking. In fact, we continued during that period to finance our competitors’ retail sales as well as our own.Many of Clayton’s borrowers have low incomes and mediocre FICO scores. But thanks to the company’ssensible lending practices, its portfolio performed well during the recession, meaning a very high percentage of ourborrowers kept their homes. Our blue-collar borrowers, in many cases, proved much better credit risks than theirhigher-income brethren.At Marmon’s railroad-car operation, lease rates have improved substantially over the past few years. Thenature of this business, however, is that only 20% or so of our leases expire annually. Consequently, improvedpricing only gradually works its way into our revenue stream. The trend, though, is strong. Our 105,000-car fleetconsists largely of tank cars, but only 8% of those transport crude oil.One further fact about our rail operation is important for you to know: Unlike many other lessors, wemanufacture our own tank cars, about 6,000 of them in a good year. We do not book anyprofit when we transfer cars from our manufacturing division to our leasing division. Our fleet is consequently placed on our books at a“bargain” price. The difference between that figure and a “retail” price is only slowly reflected in our earningsthrough smaller annual depreciation charges that we enjoy over the 30-year life of the car. Because of that fact aswell as others, Marmon’s rail fleet is worth considerably more than the $5 billion figure at which it is carried on ourbooks.Here’s the earnings recap for this sector:2014

In the meantime, it is important foryou to realize that Bank of America is, in effect, our fourth largest equity investment – and one we value highly.************Attentive readers will notice that Tesco, which last year appeared in the list of our largest common stockinvestments, is now absent. An attentiveinvestor, I’m embarrassed to report, would have sold Tesco shares earlier. I made a big mistake with this investment by dawdling.At the end of 2012 we owned 415 million shares of Tesco, then and now the leading food retailer in theU.K. and an important grocer in other countries as well. Our cost for this investment was $2.3 billion, and themarket value was a similar amount.
17In 2013, I soured somewhat on the company’s then-management and sold 114 million shares, realizing aprofit of $43 million. My leisurely pace in making sales would prove expensive. Charlie calls this sort of behavior“thumb-sucking.” (Considering what my delay cost us, he is being kind.)During 2014, Tesco’s problems worsened by the month. The company’s market share fell, its marginscontracted and accounting problems surfaced. In the world of business, bad news often surfaces serially: You see acockroach in your kitchen; as the days go by, you meet his relatives.We sold Tesco shares throughout the year and are now out of the position. (The company, we shouldmention, has hired new management, and we wish them well.) Our after-tax loss from this investment was $444million, about 1/5 of 1% of Berkshire’s net worth. In the past 50 years, we have only once realized an investmentloss that at the time of sale cost us 2% of our net worth. Twice, we experienced 1% losses. All three of these lossesoccurred in the 1974-1975 period, when we sold stocks that were very cheap in order to buy others we believed tobe even cheaper.************Our investment results have been helped by a terrific tailwind. During the 1964-2014 period, the S&P 500
rose from 84 to 2,059, which, with reinvested dividends, generated the overall return of 11,196% shown on page 2.Concurrently, the purchasing power of the dollar declined a staggering 87%. That decrease means that it now takes$1 to buy what could be bought for 13¢ in 1965 (as measured by the Consumer Price Index).There is an important message for investors in that disparate performance between stocks and dollars.Think back to our 2011 annual report, in which we defined investing as “the transfer to others of purchasing powernow with the reasoned expectation of receiving more purchasing power – after taxes have been paid on nominal gains– in the future.”The unconventional, but inescapable, conclusion to be drawn from the past fifty years is that it has been far safer to invest in a diversified collection of American businesses than to invest in securities – Treasuries, forexample – whose values have been tied to American currency. That was also true in the preceding half-century, aperiod including the Great Depression and two world wars. Investors should heed this history. To one degree oranother it is almost certain to be repeated during the next century.Stock prices will always be far morevolatilethan cash-equivalent holdings.Over the long term, however, currency-denominated instruments areriskierinvestments –farriskier investments – than widely-diversified stock portfolios that are bought over time and that are owned in a manner invoking only token fees and commissions. Thatlesson has not customarily been taught in business schools, where volatility is almost universally used as a proxy forrisk. Though this pedagogic assumption makes for easy teaching, it is dead wrong: Volatility is farfrom synonymous with risk. Popular formulas that equate the two terms lead students, investors and CEOs astray.It is true, of course, that owning equities for a day or a week or a year is far riskier (in both nominal andpurchasing-power terms) than leaving funds in cash-equivalents. That is relevant to certain investors – say,investment banks – whose viability can be threatened by declines in asset prices and which might be forced to sellsecurities during depressed markets. Additionally, any party that might have meaningful near-term needs for fundsshould keep appropriate sums in Treasuries or insured bank deposits.For the great majority of investors, however, who can – and should– invest with a multi-decade horizon, quotational declines are unimportant. Their focus should remain fixed on attaining significant gains in purchasingpower over their investing lifetime. For them, a diversified equity portfolio, bought over time, will prove far less risky than dollar-based securities.
18If the investor, instead, fears price volatility, erroneously viewing it as a measure of risk, he may,ironically, end up doing some very risky things. Recall, if you will, the pundits who six years ago bemoaned fallingstock prices and advised investing in “safe” Treasury bills or bank certificates of deposit. People who heeded thissermon are now earning a pittance on sums they had previously expected would finance a pleasant retirement. (TheS&P 500 was then below 700; now it is about 2,100.) If not for their fear of meaningless price volatility, theseinvestors could have assured themselves of a good income for life by simply buying a very low-cost index fundwhose dividends would trend upward over the years and whose principal would grow as well (with many ups anddowns, to be sure).Investors, of course, can,by their own behavior, make stock ownership highly risky. And many do. Active trading, attempts to “time” market movements, inadequate diversification, the payment of high and unnecessary feesto managers and advisors, and the use of borrowed money can destroy the decent returns that a life-long owner ofequities would otherwise enjoy. Indeed, borrowed money has noplace in the investor’s tool kit:Anythingcan happenanytimein markets. And no advisor, economist, or TV commentator – and definitely not Charlie nor I – cantell you when chaos will occur. Market forecasters will fill your ear but will never fill your wallet.The commission of the investment sins listed above is not limited to “the little guy.” Huge institutionalinvestors, viewed as a group, have long underperformed the unsophisticated index-fund investor who simply sitstight for decades. A major reason has been fees: Many institutions pay substantial sums to consultants who, in turn,recommend high-fee managers. And that is a fool’s game.There are a few investment managers, of course, who are very good – though in the short run, it’s difficultto determine whether a great record is due to luck or talent. Most advisors, however, are far better at generating highfees than they are at generating high returns. In truth, their core competence is salesmanship. Rather than listen totheir siren songs, investors – large and small – should instead read Jack Bogle’s The Little Book of Common Sense Investing.Decades ago, Ben Graham pinpointed the blame for investment failure, using a quote from Shakespeare:“The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.”The Annual MeetingThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 2
ndat the CenturyLink Center. Last year’s attendance of 39,000 set a record, and we expect a further increase this year as we celebrate our Golden Anniversary. Be therewhen the doors open at 7 a.m.Berkshire’s talented Carrie Sova will again be in charge. Carrie joined us six years ago at the age of 24 asa secretary. Then, four years ago, I asked her to take charge of the meeting – a huge undertaking, requiring amultitude of skills – and she jumped at the chance. Carrie is unflappable, ingenious and expert at bringing out thebest in the hundreds who work with her. She is aided by our entire home office crew who enjoy pitching in to makethe weekend fun and informative for our owners.And, yes, we also try to sell our visiting shareholders our products while they’re here. In fact, this yearwe will substantially increase the hours available for purchases, opening for business at the CenturyLink on Friday,May 1
st, from noon to 5 p.m. as well as the usual 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. on meeting day. So bring a smile to Charlie’s faceand do some serious shopping.Get up early on Saturday morning. At 6:20 a.m., Norman and Jake, two Texas longhorns each weighingabout a ton, will proceed down 10
thStreet to the CenturyLink. Aboard them will be a couple of our Justin Bootexecutives, who do double duty as cowboys. Following the steers will be four horses pulling a Wells Fargostagecoach. Berkshire already markets planes, trains and automobiles. Adding steers and stagecoaches to ourportfolio should seal our reputation as America’s all-purpose transportation company.
19At about 7:30 a.m. on Saturday, we will have our fourth International Newspaper Tossing Challenge. Ourtarget again will be a Clayton Home porch, located precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. When I was a teenager– in my one brief flirtation with honest labor – I tossed about 500,000 papers. So I think I’m pretty good. Challengeme! Humiliate me! Knock me down a peg! I’ll buy a Dilly Bar for anyone who lands his or her throw closer to thedoorstep than I do. The papers will run 36 to 42 pages, and you must fold them yourself (no rubber bands allowed).I’ll present a special prize to the 12-or-under contestant who makes the best toss. Deb Bosanek will be the judge.At 8:30 a.m., a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answerperiod, which (with a break for lunch at CenturyLink’s stands) will last until 3:30 p.m. After a short recess, Charlieand I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45 p.m. This business session typically lasts only a half hour or so.Your venue for shopping will be the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting and in whichproducts from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries will be for sale. If you don’t get your shopping done on Friday, slipout while Charlie’s talking on Saturday and binge on our bargains. Check the terrific BNSF railroad layout also.Even though I’m 84, it still excites me.Last year you did your part as a shopper, and most of our businesses racked up record sales. In a nine-hourperiod on Saturday, we sold 1,385 pairs of Justin boots (that’s a pair every 23 seconds), 13,440 pounds of See’scandy, 7,276 pairs of Wells Lamont work gloves and 10,000 bottles of Heinz ketchup. Heinz has a new mustardproduct, so both mustard and ketchup will be available this year. (Buy both!) Now that we are open for business onFriday as well, we expect new records in every precinct.Brooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at themeeting. After you purchase a pair, wear them the next day at our third annual “Berkshire 5K,” an 8 a.m. racestarting at the CenturyLink. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor’s Guide that will be sent toyou with your credentials for the meeting. Entrants in the race will find themselves running alongside many ofBerkshire’s managers, directors and associates. (Charlie and I, however, will sleep in.)A GEICO booth in the shopping area will be staffed by a number of the company’s top counselors fromaround the country. Stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount(usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplementalpoint: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another discount, such as that available to certain groups.)Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out our price. We can save many of you real money.Be sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry about 35 books and DVDs, among them a couple of newtitles. Last year, many shareholders purchased Max Olson’s compilation of Berkshire letters going back to 1965,and he has produced an updated edition for the meeting. We also expect to be selling an inexpensive bookcommemorating our fifty years. It’s currently a work in process, but I expect it to contain a wide variety of historicalmaterial, including documents from the 19
thCentury.An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain thecredential you will need for admission to both the meeting and other events. Airlines have sometimes jacked upprices for the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City vs.Omaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2
1⁄2hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you significant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. The savings for a couple could run to$1,000 or more. Spend that money with us.At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72
ndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. Last year in the week surrounding the meeting, the store dida record $40,481,817 of business. (An average week for NFM’s Omaha store is about $9 million.)
20To obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, April 28th
and Monday, May 4thinclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will evenapply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting butwhich, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation.NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. on Saturday and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.on Sunday. From 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday, NFM is having a picnic to which you are all invited.At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May 1
st. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 3rd, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will remain open until 6 p.m. In recent years, our three-day volume has far exceeded our salesin all of December, normally a jeweler’s best month.We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 27
ththrough Saturday, May 9th. During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that shows youare a Berkshire holder.On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, Norman Beck, a remarkable magician from Dallas, willbewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the world’s top bridgeexperts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. Don’t play them for money.My friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. I metAriel when she was nine and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Now, she’s a sophomore atPrinceton, having already represented the United States in the 2012 Olympics. If you don’t mind embarrassingyourself, test your skills against her, beginning at 1 p.m. Bill Gates and I will lead off and try to soften her up.Gorat’s and Piccolo’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 3
rd. Both will be serving until 10 p.m., with Gorat’s opening at 1 p.m. and Piccolo’s opening at 4 p.m. These restaurantsare my favorites, and I will eat at both of them on Sunday evening. Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat’s,call 402-551-3733 on April 1
st(but not before); for Piccolo’s, call 402-346-2865. At Piccolo’s, order a giant rootbeer float for dessert. Only sissies get the small one.We will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at themeeting, asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists andtheir e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, who retired last year after sixty years at Fortune, but remains theexpert on business and financial matters, and who may be e-mailed at loomisbrk@gmail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, atBerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the mostinteresting and important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if youkeep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than twoquestions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your namementioned if your question is asked.)We will also have a panel of three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year the insurance specialist willbe Gary Ransom of Dowling & Partners. Questions that deal with our non-insurance operations will come fromJonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Our hope is that the analysts andjournalists will ask questions that add to our owners’ understanding and knowledge of their investment.
21Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be tough,for sure, and that’s the way we like it. All told we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from eachanalyst and journalist and for 18 from the audience. (Last year we had 62 in total.) The questioners from theaudience will be chosen by means of 11 drawings that will take place at 8:15 a.m. on the morning of the annualmeeting. Each of the 11 microphones installed in the arena and main overflow room will host, so to speak, adrawing.While I’m on the subject of our owners’ gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believeall shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and should also haveadequate time to analyze it. That’s why we try to issue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and whyour annual meeting is always held on a Saturday. We do not talk one-on-one to large institutional investors oranalysts, treating them instead as we do all other shareholders. ************We get terrific help at meeting time from literally thousands of Omaha residents and businesses whowant you to enjoy yourselves. This year, because we expect record attendance, we have worried about a shortage ofhotel rooms. To deal with that possible problem, Airbnb is making a special effort to obtain listings for the periodaround meeting time and is likely to have a wide array of accommodations to offer. Airbnb’s services may beespecially helpful to shareholders who expect to spend only a single night in Omaha and are aware that last year afew hotels required guests to pay for a minimum of three nights. That gets expensive. Those people on a tightbudget should check the Airbnb website. ************For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-Stars who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I believe the mindset of ourmanagers also to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies.Most of our managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business “home runs” means as much tothem as their paycheck.Equally important, however, are the 24 men and women who work with me at our corporate office. Thisgroup efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 24,100-page Federalincome tax return and oversees the filing of 3,400 state tax returns, responds to countless shareholder and mediainquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country’s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board’sactivities – and the list goes on and on.They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easyand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year they dealt with the 40universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They also handleall kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and french fries (smothered inHeinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly do feel like tap dancing to work every day.Last year, for the annual report, we dropped our 48-year-old “no pictures” policy – who says I’m notflexible? – and ran a photo of our remarkable home-office crew that was taken at our Christmas lunch. I didn’t warnthe gang of the public exposure they were to receive, so they didn’t have on their Sunday best. This year was adifferent story: On the facing page you will see what our group looks like when they think someone will be noticing.However they dress, their performance is mind-boggling.Come meet them on May 2
ndand enjoy our Woodstock for Capitalists.February 27, 2015 Warren E. BuffettChairman of the Board22BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.ACQUISITION CRITERIAWe are eager to hearfrom principals or their representativesabout businesses that meet all of the following criteria: (1) Large purchases (at least $75 million of pre-tax earnings unless the business will fit into one of our existing units),(2) Demonstrated consistent earning power (future projections are of no interest to us, nor are “turnaround” situations),(3) Businesses earning good returns on equity while employing little or no debt,(4) Management in place (we can’t supply it),(5) Simple businesses (if there’s lots of technology, we won’t understand it),(6) An offering price (we don’t want to waste our time or that of the seller by talking, even preliminarily, about a transactionwhen price is unknown).The larger the company, the greater will be our interest: We would like to make an acquisition in the $5-20 billion range. We are not interested, however, in receiving suggestions about purchases we might make in the general stock market.We will not engage in unfriendly takeovers. We can promise complete confidentiality and a very fast answer – customarilywithin five minutes – as to whether we’re interested. We prefer to buy for cash, but will consider issuing stock when we receive asmuch in intrinsic business value as we give.We don’t participate in auctions. Charlie and I frequently get approached about acquisitions that don’t come close to meeting our tests: We’ve found that if youadvertise an interest in buying collies, a lot of people will call hoping to sell you their cocker spaniels. A line from a country songexpresses our feeling about new ventures, turnarounds, or auction-like sales: “When the phone don’t ring, you’ll know it’s me.”
23Berkshire – Past, Present and FutureIn the BeginningOn May 6, 1964, Berkshire Hathaway, then run by a man named Seabury Stanton, sent a letter to itsshareholders offering to buy 225,000 shares of its stock for $11.375 per share. I had expected the letter; I wassurprised by the price.Berkshire then had 1,583,680 shares outstanding. About 7% of these were owned by Buffett PartnershipLtd. (“BPL”), an investing entity that I managed and in which I had virtually all of my net worth. Shortly before thetender offer was mailed, Stanton had asked me at what price BPL would sell its holdings. I answered $11.50, and hesaid, “Fine, we have a deal.” Then came Berkshire’s letter, offering an eighth of a point less. I bristled at Stanton’sbehavior and didn’t tender.That was a monumentally stupid decision.Berkshire was then a northern textile manufacturer mired in a terrible business. The industry in which itoperated was heading south, both metaphorically and physically. And Berkshire, for a variety of reasons, was unableto change course.That was true even though the industry’s problems had long been widely understood. Berkshire’s ownBoard minutes of July 29, 1954, laid out the grim facts: “The textile industry in New England started going out ofbusiness forty years ago. During the war years this trend was stopped. The trend must continue until supply anddemand have been balanced.”About a year after that board meeting, Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates and Hathaway Manufacturing –both with roots in the 19
thCentury – joined forces, taking the name we bear today. With its fourteen plants and10,000 employees, the merged company became the giant of New England textiles. What the two managementsviewed as a merger agreement, however, soon morphed into a suicide pact. During the seven years following theconsolidation, Berkshire operated at an overall loss, and its net worth shrunk by 37%.Meanwhile, the company closed nine plants, sometimes using the liquidation proceeds to repurchaseshares. And that pattern caught my attention.I purchased BPL’s first shares of Berkshire in December 1962, anticipating more closings and morerepurchases. The stock was then selling for $7.50, a wide discount from per-share working capital of $10.25 andbook value of $20.20. Buying the stock at that price was like picking up a discarded cigar butt that had one puffremaining in it. Though the stub might be ugly and soggy, the puff would be free. Once that momentary pleasurewas enjoyed, however, no more could be expected.Berkshire thereafter stuck to the script: It soon closed another two plants, and in that May 1964 move, setout to repurchase shares with the shutdown proceeds. The price that Stanton offered was 50% above the cost of ouroriginal purchases. There it was – my free puff, just waiting for me, after which I could look elsewhere for otherdiscarded butts.Instead, irritated by Stanton’s chiseling, I ignored his offer and began to aggressively buy more Berkshireshares.
24By April 1965, BPL owned 392,633 shares (out of 1,017,547 then outstanding) and at an early-May boardmeeting we formally took control of the company. Through Seabury’s and my childish behavior – after all, whatwas an eighth of a point to either of us? – he lost his job, and I found myself with more than 25% of BPL’s capitalinvested in a terrible business about which I knew very little. I became the dog who caught the car.Because of Berkshire’s operating losses and share repurchases, its net worth at the end of fiscal 1964 hadfallen to $22 million from $55 million at the time of the 1955 merger. The full $22 million was required by thetextile operation: The company had no excess cash and owed its bank $2.5 million. (Berkshire’s 1964 annual reportis reproduced on pages 130-142.)For a time I got lucky: Berkshire immediately enjoyed two years of good operating conditions. Better yet,its earnings in those years were free of income tax because it possessed a large loss carry-forward that had arisenfrom the disastrous results in earlier years.Then the honeymoon ended. During the 18 years following 1966, we struggled unremittingly with thetextile business, all to no avail. But stubbornness – stupidity? – has its limits. In 1985, I finally threw in the toweland closed the operation. ************Undeterred by my first mistake of committing much of BPL’s resources to a dying business, I quicklycompounded the error. Indeed, my second blunder was far more serious than the first, eventually becoming the mostcostly in my career.Early in 1967, I had Berkshire pay $8.6 million to buy National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a small butpromising Omaha-based insurer. (A tiny sister company was also included in the deal.) Insurance was in my sweetspot: I understood and liked the industry.Jack Ringwalt, the owner of NICO, was a long-time friend who wanted to sell to me – me, personally. Inno way was his offer intended for Berkshire. So why did I purchase NICO for Berkshire rather than for BPL? I’vehad 48 years to think about that question, and I’ve yet to come up with a good answer. I simply made a colossalmistake.If BPL had been the purchaser, my partners and I would have owned 100% of a fine business, destined toform the base for building the company Berkshire has become. Moreover, our growth would not have been impededfor nearly two decades by the unproductive funds imprisoned in the textile operation. Finally, our subsequentacquisitions would have been owned in their entirety by my partners and me rather than being 39%-owned by thelegacy shareholders of Berkshire, to whom we had no obligation. Despite these facts staring me in the face, I optedto marry 100% of an excellent business (NICO) to a 61%-owned terrible business (Berkshire Hathaway), a decisionthat eventually diverted $100 billion or so from BPL partners to a collection of strangers. ************One more confession and then I’ll go on to more pleasant topics: Can you believe that in 1975 I boughtWaumbec Mills, another New England textile company? Of course, the purchase price was a “bargain” based on theassets we received and theprojectedsynergies with Berkshire’s existing textile business. Nevertheless – surprise,surprise – Waumbec was a disaster, with the mill having to be closed down not many years later.And now some good news: The northern textile industry is finally extinct. You need no longer panic if youhear that I’ve been spotted wandering around New England.
25Charlie Straightens Me OutMy cigar-butt strategy worked very well while I was managing small sums. Indeed, the many dozens offree puffs I obtained in the 1950s made that decade by far the best of my life for both relative and absoluteinvestment performance.Even then, however, I made a few exceptions to cigar butts, the most important being GEICO. Thanks to a1951 conversation I had with Lorimer Davidson, a wonderful man who later became CEO of the company, I learnedthat GEICO was a terrific business and promptly put 65% of my $9,800 net worth into its shares. Most of my gainsin those early years, though, came from investments in mediocre companies that traded at bargain prices. BenGraham had taught me that technique, and it worked.But a major weakness in this approach gradually became apparent: Cigar-butt investing was scalable onlyto a point. With large sums, it would never work well.In addition, though marginal businesses purchased at cheap prices may be attractive as short-terminvestments, they are the wrong foundation on which to build a large and enduring enterprise. Selecting a marriagepartner clearly requires more demanding criteria than does dating. (Berkshire, it should be noted, would have been ahighly satisfactory “date”: If we had taken Seabury Stanton’s $11.375 offer for our shares, BPL’s weighted annualreturn on its Berkshire investment would have been about 40%.) ************It took Charlie Munger to break my cigar-butt habits and set the course for building a business that couldcombine huge size with satisfactory profits. Charlie had grown up a few hundred feet from where I now live and asa youth had worked, as did I, in my grandfather’s grocery store. Nevertheless, it was 1959 before I met Charlie, longafter he had left Omaha to make Los Angeles his home. I was then 28 and he was 35. The Omaha doctor whointroduced us predicted that we would hit it off – and we did.If you’ve attended our annual meetings, you know Charlie has a wide-ranging brilliance, a prodigiousmemory, and some firm opinions. I’m not exactly wishy-washy myself, and we sometimes don’t agree. In 56 years,however, we’ve never had an argument. When we differ, Charlie usually ends the conversation by saying: “Warren,think it over and you’ll agree with me because you’re smart and I’m right.”What most of you donotknow about Charlie is that architecture is among his passions. Though he beganhis career as a practicing lawyer (with his time billed at $15 per hour), Charlie made his first real money in his 30sby designing and building five apartment projects near Los Angeles. Concurrently, he designed the house that helives in today – some 55 years later. (Like me, Charlie can’t be budged if he is happy in his surroundings.) In recentyears, Charlie has designed large dorm complexes at Stanford and the University of Michigan and today, at age 91,is working on another major project.From my perspective, though, Charlie’s most important architectural feat was the design of today’sBerkshire. The blueprint he gave me was simple: Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderfulprices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices.
26Altering my behavior is not an easy task (ask my family). I had enjoyed reasonable success withoutCharlie’s input, so why should I listen to a lawyer who had never spent a day in business school (when – ahem – I had attendedthree). But Charlie never tired of repeating his maxims about business and investing to me, and hislogic was irrefutable. Consequently, Berkshire has been built to Charlie’s blueprint. My role has been that of generalcontractor, with the CEOs of Berkshire’s subsidiaries doing the real work as sub-contractors.The year 1972 was a turning point for Berkshire (though not without occasional backsliding on my part –remember my 1975 purchase of Waumbec). We had the opportunity then to buy See’s Candy for Blue Chip Stamps,a company in which Charlie, I and Berkshire had major stakes, and which was later merged into Berkshire.See’s was a legendary West Coast manufacturer and retailer of boxed chocolates, then annually earningabout $4 million pre-tax while utilizing only $8 million of net tangible assets. Moreover, the company had a hugeasset that did not appear on its balance sheet: a broad and durable competitive advantage that gave it significantpricing power. That strength was virtually certain to give See’s major gains in earnings over time. Better yet, thesewould materialize with only minor amounts of incremental investment. In other words, See’s could be expected togush cash for decades to come.The family controlling See’s wanted $30 million for the business, and Charlie rightly said it was worth thatmuch. But I didn’t want to pay more than $25 million and wasn’t all that enthusiastic even at that figure. (A pricethat was three times net tangible assets made me gulp.) My misguided caution could have scuttled a terrificpurchase. But, luckily, the sellers decided to take our $25 million bid.To date, See’s has earned $1.9 billion pre-tax, with its growth having required added investment of only$40 million. See’s has thus been able to distribute huge sums that have helped Berkshire buy other businesses that,in turn, have themselves produced large distributable profits. (Envision rabbits breeding.) Additionally, throughwatching See’s in action, I gained a business education about the value of powerful brands that opened my eyes tomany other profitable investments. ************Even with Charlie’s blueprint, I have made plenty of mistakes since Waumbec. The most gruesome wasDexter Shoe. When we purchased the company in 1993, it had a terrific record and in no way looked to me like acigar butt. Its competitive strengths, however, were soon to evaporate because of foreign competition. And I simplydidn’t see that coming.Consequently, Berkshire paid $433 million for Dexter and, rather promptly, its value went to zero. GAAPaccounting, however, doesn’t come close to recording the magnitude of my error. The fact is that I gave Berkshirestock to the sellers of Dexter rather than cash, and the shares I used for the purchase are now worth about $5.7billion. As a financial disaster, this one deserves a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records.Several of my subsequent errors also involved the use of Berkshire shares to purchase businesses whoseearnings were destined to simply limp along. Mistakes of that kind are deadly. Trading shares of a wonderfulbusiness – which Berkshire most certainly is – for ownership of a so-so business irreparably destroys value.We’ve also suffered financially when this mistake has been committed by companies whose sharesBerkshire has owned (with the errors sometimes occurring while I was serving as a director). Too often CEOs seemblind to an elementary reality: The intrinsic value of the shares you give in an acquisition must not be greater thanthe intrinsic value of the business you receive.
27I’ve yet to see an investment banker quantify this all-important math when he is presenting a stock-for-stock deal to the board of a potential acquirer. Instead, the banker’s focus will be on describing “customary”premiums-to-market-price that are currently being paid for acquisitions – an absolutely asinine way to evaluate theattractiveness of an acquisition – or whether the deal will increase the acquirer’s earnings-per-share (which in itselfshould be far from determinative). In striving to achieve the desired per-share number, a panting CEO and his“helpers” will often conjure up fanciful “synergies.” (As a director of 19 companies over the years, I’ve never heard“dis-synergies” mentioned, though I’ve witnessed plenty of these once deals have closed.) Post mortems ofacquisitions, in which reality is honestly compared to the original projections, are rare in American boardrooms.They should instead be standard practice.I can promise you that long after I’m gone, Berkshire’s CEO and Board will carefully make intrinsic valuecalculations before issuing shares in any acquisitions. You can’t get rich trading a hundred-dollar bill for eight tens(even if your advisor has handed you an expensive “fairness” opinion endorsing that swap). ************Overall, Berkshire’s acquisitions have worked out well – and verywell in the case of a few large ones. So, too, have our investments in marketable securities. The latter are always valued on our balance sheet at their marketprices so any gains – including those unrealized – are immediately reflected in our net worth. But the businesses webuy outright are never revalued upward on our balance sheet, even when we could sell them for many billions ofdollars more than their carrying value. The unrecorded gains in the value of Berkshire’s subsidiaries have becomehuge, with these growing at a particularly fast pace in the last decade.Listening to Charlie has paid off.
28Berkshire TodayBerkshire is now a sprawling conglomerate, constantly trying to sprawl further.Conglomerates, it should be acknowledged, have a terrible reputation with investors. And they richlydeserve it. Let me first explain why they are in the doghouse, and then I will go on to describe why theconglomerate form brings huge and enduring advantages to Berkshire.Since I entered the business world, conglomerates have enjoyed several periods of extreme popularity, thesilliest of which occurred in the late 1960s. The drill for conglomerate CEOs then was simple: By personality,promotion or dubious accounting – and often by all three – these managers drove a fledgling conglomerate’s stockto, say, 20 times earnings and then issued shares as fast as possible to acquire another business selling at ten-or-sotimes earnings. They immediately applied “pooling” accounting to the acquisition, which – with not a dime’s worthof change in the underlying businesses – automatically increased per-share earnings, and used the rise as proof ofmanagerial genius. They next explained to investors that this sort of talent justified the maintenance, or even theenhancement, of the acquirer’s p/e multiple. And, finally, they promised to endlessly repeat this procedure andthereby create ever-increasing per-share earnings.Wall Street’s love affair with this hocus-pocus intensified as the 1960s rolled by. The Street’s denizens arealways ready to suspend disbelief when dubious maneuvers are used to manufacture rising per-share earnings,particularly if these acrobatics produce mergers that generate huge fees for investment bankers. Auditors willinglysprinkled their holy water on the conglomerates’ accounting and sometimes even made suggestions as to how tofurther juice the numbers. For many, gushers of easy money washed away ethical sensitivities.Since the per-share earnings gains of an expanding conglomerate came from exploiting p/e differences, itsCEO had to search for businesses selling at low multiples of earnings. These, of course, were characteristicallymediocre businesses with poor long-term prospects. This incentive to bottom-fish usually led to a conglomerate’scollection of underlying businesses becoming more and more junky. That mattered little to investors: It was dealvelocity and pooling accounting they looked to for increased earnings.The resulting firestorm of merger activity was fanned by an adoring press. Companies such as ITT, LittonIndustries, Gulf & Western, and LTV were lionized, and their CEOs became celebrities. (These once-famousconglomerates are now long gone. As Yogi Berra said, “Every Napoleon meets his Watergate.”)Back then, accounting shenanigans of all sorts – many of them ridiculously transparent – were excused oroverlooked. Indeed, having an accounting wizard at the helm of an expanding conglomerate was viewed as a hugeplus: Shareholders in those instances could be sure that reportedearnings would never disappoint, no matter how bad the operating realities of the business might become.In the late 1960s, I attended a meeting at which an acquisitive CEO bragged of his “bold, imaginativeaccounting.” Most of the analysts listening responded with approving nods, seeing themselves as having found amanager whose forecasts were certain to be met, whatever the business results might be.
29Eventually, however, the clock struck twelve, and everything turned to pumpkins and mice. Once again, itbecame evident that business models based on the serial issuances of overpriced shares – just like chain-lettermodels – most assuredly redistribute wealth, but in no way create it. Both phenomena, nevertheless, periodicallyblossom in our country – they are every promoter’s dream – though often they appear in a carefully-crafted disguise.The ending is always the same: Money flows from the gullible to the fraudster. And with stocks, unlike chain letters,the sums hijacked can be staggering.At both BPL and Berkshire, we haveneverinvested in companies that are hell-bent on issuing shares. That behavior is one of the surest indicators of a promotion-minded management, weak accounting, a stock that isoverpriced and – all too often – outright dishonesty. ************So what do Charlie and I find so attractive about Berkshire’s conglomerate structure? To put the casesimply: If the conglomerate form is used judiciously, it is an ideal structure for maximizing long-term capitalgrowth.One of the heralded virtues of capitalism is that it efficiently allocates funds. The argument is that marketswill direct investment to promising businesses and deny it to those destined to wither. That is true: With all itsexcesses, market-driven allocation of capital is usually far superior to any alternative.Nevertheless, there are often obstacles to the rational movement of capital. As those 1954 Berkshireminutes made clear, capital withdrawals within the textile industry that should have been obvious were delayed fordecades because of the vain hopes and self-interest of managements. Indeed, I myself delayed abandoning ourobsolete textile mills for far too long.A CEO with capital employed in a declining operation seldom elects to massively redeploy that capital intounrelated activities. A move of that kind would usually require that long-time associates be fired and mistakes beadmitted. Moreover, it’s unlikelythatCEO would be the manager you would wish to handle the redeployment jobeven if he or she was inclined to undertake it.At the shareholder level, taxes and frictional costs weigh heavily on individual investors when they attemptto reallocate capital among businesses and industries. Even tax-free institutional investors face major costs as theymove capital because they usually need intermediaries to do this job. A lot of mouths with expensive tastes thenclamor to be fed – among them investment bankers, accountants, consultants, lawyers and such capital-reallocatorsas leveraged buyout operators. Money-shufflers don’t come cheap.In contrast, a conglomerate such as Berkshire is perfectly positioned to allocate capital rationally and atminimal cost. Of course, form itself is no guarantee of success: We have made plenty of mistakes, and we will makemore. Our structural advantages, however, are formidable.At Berkshire, we can – without incurring taxes or much in the way of other costs – move huge sums frombusinesses that have limited opportunities for incremental investment to other sectors with greater promise.Moreover, we are free of historical biases created by lifelong association with a given industry and are not subject topressures from colleagues having a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. That’s important: If horses hadcontrolled investment decisions, there would have been no auto industry.
30Another major advantage we possess is the ability to buy piecesof wonderful businesses – a.k.a. common stocks. That’s not a course of action open to most managements. Over our history, this strategic alternative hasproved to be very helpful; a broad range of options always sharpens decision-making. The businesses we are offeredby the stock market every day – in small pieces, to be sure – are often far more attractive than the businesses we areconcurrently being offered in their entirety. Additionally, the gains we’ve realized from marketable securities havehelped us make certain large acquisitions that would otherwise have been beyond our financial capabilities.In effect, the world is Berkshire’s oyster – a world offering us a range of opportunities far beyond thoserealistically open to most companies. We are limited, of course, to businesses whose economic prospects we canevaluate. And that’s a serious limitation: Charlie and I have no idea what a great many companies will look like tenyears from now. But that limitation is much smaller than that borne by an executive whose experience has beenconfined to a single industry. On top of that, we can profitably scale to a farlarger size than the many businesses that are constrained by the limited potential of the single industry in which they operate.I mentioned earlier that See’s Candy had produced huge earnings compared to its modest capitalrequirements. We would have loved, of course, to intelligently use those funds to expand our candy operation. Butour many attempts to do so were largely futile. So, without incurring tax inefficiencies or frictional costs, we haveused the excess funds generated by See’s to help purchase other businesses. If See’s had remained a stand-alonecompany, its earnings would have had to be distributed to investors to redeploy, sometimes after being heavilydepleted by large taxes and, almost always, by significant frictional and agency costs. ************Berkshire has one further advantage that has become increasingly important over the years: We are now thehome of choice for the owners and managers of many outstanding businesses.Families that own successful businesses have multiple options when they contemplate sale. Frequently, thebest decision is to do nothing. There are worse things in life than having a prosperous business that one understandswell. But sitting tight is seldom recommended by Wall Street. (Don’t ask the barber whether you need a haircut.)When one part of a family wishes to sell while others wish to continue, a public offering often makessense. But, when owners wish to cash out entirely, they usually consider one of two paths.The first is sale to a competitor who is salivating at the possibility of wringing “synergies” from thecombining of the two companies. This buyer invariably contemplates getting rid of large numbers of the seller’sassociates, the very people who have helped the owner build his business. A caring owner, however – and there areplenty of them – usually does not want to leave his long-time associates sadly singing the old country song: “ She got the goldmine, I got the shaft.”The second choice for sellers is the Wall Street buyer. For some years, these purchasers accurately calledthemselves “leveraged buyout firms.” When that term got a bad name in the early 1990s – remember RJR andBarbarians at the Gate? – these buyers hastily relabeled themselves “private-equity.”The name may have changed but that was all: Equity is dramatically reducedand debt is piled on in virtually all private-equity purchases. Indeed, the amount that a private-equity purchaser offers to the seller is in partdetermined by the buyer assessing themaximumamount of debt that can be placed on the acquired company.
31Later, if things go well and equity begins to build, leveraged buy-out shops will often seek to re-leveragewith new borrowings. They then typically use part of the proceeds to pay a huge dividend that drives equity sharplydownward, sometimes even to a negative figure.In truth, “equity” is a dirty word for many private-equity buyers; what they love is debt. And, because debtis currently so inexpensive, these buyers can frequently pay top dollar. Later, the business will be resold, often toanother leveraged buyer. In effect, the business becomes a piece of merchandise.Berkshire offers a third choice to the business owner who wishes to sell: a permanent home, in which thecompany’s people and culture will be retained (though, occasionally, management changes will be needed). Beyondthat, any business we acquire dramatically increases its financial strength and ability to grow. Its days of dealingwith banks and Wall Street analysts are also forever ended.Some sellers don’t care about these matters. But, when sellers do, Berkshire does not have a lot ofcompetition. ************Sometimes pundits propose that Berkshire spin-off certain of its businesses. These suggestions make nosense. Our companies are worth more as part of Berkshire than as separate entities. One reason is our ability tomove funds between businesses or into new ventures instantly and without tax. In addition, certain costs duplicatethemselves, in full or part, if operations are separated. Here’s the most obvious example: Berkshire incurs nominalcosts for its single board of directors; were our dozens of subsidiaries to be split off, the overall cost for directorswould soar. So, too, would regulatory and administration expenditures.Finally, there are sometimes important tax efficiencies for Subsidiary A because we own Subsidiary B. Forexample, certain tax credits that are available to our utilities are currently realizable only because we generate hugeamounts of taxable income at other Berkshire operations. That gives Berkshire Hathaway Energy a major advantageover most public-utility companies in developing wind and solar projects.Investment bankers, being paid as they are for action, constantly urge acquirers to pay 20% to 50%premiums over market price for publicly-held businesses. The bankers tell the buyer that the premium is justified for“control value” and for the wonderful things that are going to happen once the acquirer’s CEO takes charge. (Whatacquisition-hungry manager will challengethatassertion?)A few years later, bankers – bearing straight faces – again appear and just as earnestly urge spinning off theearlier acquisition in order to “unlock shareholder value.” Spin-offs, of course, strip the owning company of itspurported “control value” without any compensating payment. The bankers explain that the spun-off company willflourish because its management will be more entrepreneurial, having been freed from the smothering bureaucracyof the parent company. (So much for that talented CEO we met earlier.)If the divesting company later wishes to reacquire the spun-off operation, it presumably would again beurged by its bankers to pay a hefty “control” premium for the privilege. (Mental “flexibility” of this sort by thebanking fraternity has prompted the saying that fees too often lead to transactions rather than transactions leading tofees.)It’s possible, of course, that someday a spin-off or sale at Berkshire would be required by regulators.Berkshire carried out such a spin-off in 1979, when new regulations for bank holding companies forced us to divesta bank we owned in Rockford, Illinois.
32Voluntary spin-offs, though, make no sense for us: We would lose control value, capital-allocationflexibility and, in some cases, important tax advantages. The CEOs who brilliantly run our subsidiaries now wouldhave difficulty in being as effective if running a spun-off operation, given the operating and financial advantagesderived from Berkshire’s ownership. Moreover, the parent and the spun-off operations, once separated, would likelyincur moderately greater costs than existed when they were combined. ************Before I depart the subject of spin-offs, let’s look at a lesson to be learned from a conglomerate mentionedearlier: LTV. I’ll summarize here, but those who enjoy a good financial story should read the piece about JimmyLing that ran in the October 1982 issue ofD Magazine. Look it up on the Internet.Through a lot of corporate razzle-dazzle, Ling had taken LTV from sales of only $36 million in 1965 tonumber 14 on the Fortune 500 list just two years later. Ling, it should be noted, had never displayed any managerialskills. But Charlie told me long ago to never underestimate the man who overestimates himself. And Ling had nopeer in that respect.Ling’s strategy, which he labeled “project redeployment,” was to buy a large company and then partiallyspin off its various divisions. In LTV’s 1966 annual report, he explained the magic that would follow: “Mostimportantly, acquisitions must meet the test of the 2 plus 2 equals 5 (or 6) formula.” The press, the public and WallStreet loved this sort of talk.In 1967 Ling bought Wilson & Co., a huge meatpacker that also had interests in golf equipment andpharmaceuticals. Soon after, he split the parent into three businesses, Wilson & Co. (meatpacking), Wilson SportingGoods and Wilson Pharmaceuticals, each of which was to be partially spun off. These companies quickly becameknown on Wall Street as Meatball, Golf Ball and Goof Ball.Soon thereafter, it became clear that, like Icarus, Ling had flown too close to the sun. By the early 1970s,Ling’s empire was melting, and he himself had been spun off from LTV . . . that is,fired. Periodically, financial markets will become divorced from reality – you can count on that. More JimmyLings will appear. They will look and sound authoritative. The press will hang on their every word. Bankers willfight for their business. What they are saying will recently have “worked.” Their early followers will be feeling veryclever. Our suggestion: Whatever their line, never forget that 2+2 will always equal 4. And when someone tells youhow old-fashioned that math is --- zip up your wallet, take a vacation and come back in a few years to buy stocks atcheap prices. ************Today Berkshire possesses (1) an unmatched collection of businesses, most of them now enjoyingfavorable economic prospects; (2) a cadre of outstanding managers who, with few exceptions, are unusually devotedto both the subsidiary they operateandto Berkshire; (3) an extraordinary diversity of earnings, premier financialstrength and oceans of liquidity that we will maintain under allcircumstances; (4) a first-choice ranking among many owners and managers who are contemplating sale of their businesses and (5) in a point related to thepreceding item, a culture, distinctive in many ways from that of most large companies, that we have worked 50years to develop and that is now rock-solid.These strengths provide us a wonderful foundation on which to build.
33The Next 50 Years at BerkshireNow let’s take a look at the road ahead. Bear in mind that if I had attempted 50 years ago to gauge whatwas coming, certain of my predictions would have been far off the mark. With that warning, I will tell you what Iwould say to my family today if they asked me about Berkshire’s future.
‹First and definitely foremost, I believe that the chance of permanent capital loss for patient Berkshireshareholders is as low as can be found among single-company investments. That’s because our per-shareintrinsic business valueis almost certain to advance over time.This cheery prediction comes, however, with an important caution: If an investor’s entry point intoBerkshire stock is unusually high – at a price, say, approaching double book value, which Berkshire shareshave occasionally reached – it may well be many years before the investor can realize a profit. In otherwords, a sound investment can morph into a rash speculation if it is bought at an elevated price. Berkshireis not exempt from this truth.Purchases of Berkshire that investors make at a price modestly above the level at which the companywould repurchase its shares, however, should produce gains within a reasonable period of time. Berkshire’sdirectors will only authorize repurchases at a price they believe to be well belowintrinsic value. (In our view, that is an essential criterion for repurchases that is often ignored by other managements.)For those investors who plan to sell within a year or two after their purchase, I can offer noassurances, whatever the entry price. Movements of the general stock market during such abbreviated periods willlikely be far more important in determining your results than the concomitant change in the intrinsic valueof your Berkshire shares. As Ben Graham said many decades ago: “In the short-term the market is a votingmachine; in the long-run it acts as a weighing machine.” Occasionally, the voting decisions of investors –amateurs and professionals alike – border on lunacy.Since I know of no way to reliably predict market movements, I recommend that you purchase Berkshiresharesonlyif you expect to hold them for at least five years. Those who seek short-term profits should lookelsewhere.Another warning: Berkshire shares should not be purchased with borrowed money. There have been threetimes since 1965 when our stock has fallen about 50% from its high point. Someday, something close tothis kind of drop will happen again, and no one knows when. Berkshire will almost certainly be asatisfactory holding forinvestors. But it could well be a disastrous choice for speculators employingleverage.
‹I believe the chance of any event causing Berkshire to experience financial problems is essentially zero.We will always be prepared for the thousand-year flood; in fact, if it occurs we will be selling life jacketsto the unprepared. Berkshire played an important role as a “first responder” during the 2008-2009meltdown, and we have since more than doubled the strength of our balance sheet and our earningspotential. Your company is the Gibraltar of American business and will remain so.Financial staying power requires a company to maintain three strengths under allcircumstances: (1) a large and reliable stream of earnings; (2) massive liquid assets and (3) nosignificant near-term cash requirements. Ignoring that last necessity is what usually leads companies to experience unexpectedproblems: Too often, CEOs of profitable companies feel they will always be able to refund maturingobligations, however large these are. In 2008-2009, many managements learned how perilous that mindsetcan be.Here’s how we willalwaysstand on the three essentials. First, our earnings stream is huge and comes froma vast array of businesses. Our shareholders now own many large companies that have durable competitiveadvantages, and we will acquire more of those in the future. Our diversification assures Berkshire’scontinued profitability, even if a catastrophe causes insurance losses that far exceed any previouslyexperienced.34Next up is cash. At a healthy business, cash is sometimes thought of as something to be minimized – as anunproductive asset that acts as a drag on such markers as return on equity. Cash, though, is to a business asoxygen is to an individual: never thought about when it is present, the only thing in mind when it is absent.American business provided a case study of that in 2008. In September of that year, many long-prosperouscompanies suddenly wondered whether their checks would bounce in the days ahead. Overnight, theirfinancial oxygen disappeared.At Berkshire, our “breathing” went uninterrupted. Indeed, in a three-week period spanning late Septemberand early October, we supplied $15.6billionof fresh money to American businesses.We could do that because we always maintain at least $20 billion – and usually far more – in cashequivalents. And by that we mean U.S. Treasury bills, not other substitutes for cash that are claimed todeliver liquidity and actually do so,exceptwhen it is truly needed. When bills come due, only cash is legaltender. Don’t leave home without it.Finally – getting to our third point – we will never engage in operating or investment practices that canresult in sudden demands for large sums. That means we will not expose Berkshire to short-term debtmaturities of size nor enter into derivative contracts or other business arrangements that could require largecollateral calls.Some years ago, we became a party to certain derivative contracts that we believed were significantlymispriced and that had only minor collateral requirements. These have proved to be quite profitable.Recently, however, newly-written derivative contracts have required full collateralization. And that endedour interest in derivatives, regardless of what profit potential they might offer. We have not, for someyears, written these contracts, except for a few needed for operational purposes at our utility businesses.Moreover, we will not write insurance contracts that give policyholders the right to cash out at their option.Manylifeinsurance products contain redemption features that make them susceptible to a “run” in times ofextreme panic. Contracts of that sort, however, do not exist in the property-casualty world that we inhabit. Ifour premium volume should shrink, our float would decline – but only at a very slow pace.The reason for our conservatism, which may impress some people as extreme, is that it is entirelypredictable that people will occasionally panic, but not at all predictable when this will happen. Thoughpractically all days are relatively uneventful, tomorrow is alwaysuncertain. (I felt no special apprehension on December 6, 1941 or September 10, 2001.) And if you can’t predict what tomorrow will bring, youmust be prepared for whatever it does.A CEO who is 64 and plans to retire at 65 may have his own special calculus in evaluating risks that haveonly a tiny chance of happening in a given year. He may, in fact, be “right” 99% of the time. Those odds,however, hold no appeal for us. We will never play financial Russian roulette with the funds you’veentrusted to us, even if the metaphorical gun has 100 chambers and only one bullet. In our view, it ismadness to risk losing what youneedin pursuing what you simplydesire.
‹Despite our conservatism, I think we will be able everyyear to build the underlying per-share earning power of Berkshire. That doesnotmean operating earnings will increase each year – far from it. The U.S.economy will ebb and flow – though mostly flow – and, when it weakens, so will our current earnings. Butwe will continue to achieve organic gains, make bolt-on acquisitions and enter new fields. I believe,therefore, that Berkshire will annually add to its underlyingearning power. In some years the gains will be substantial, and at other times they will be minor. Markets, competition,and chance will determine when opportunities come our way. Through it all, Berkshire will keep movingforward, powered by the array of solid businesses we now possess and the new companies we willpurchase. In most years, moreover, our country’s economy will provide a strong tailwind for business. Weare blessed to have the United States as our home field.35‹The bad news is that Berkshire’s long-term gains – measured by percentages, not by dollars – cannot bedramatic andwill not come closeto those achieved in the past 50 years. The numbers have become too big.I think Berkshire will outperform the average American company, but our advantage, if any, won’t begreat.Eventually – probably between ten and twenty years from now – Berkshire’s earnings and capital resourceswill reach a level that will not allow management to intelligently reinvest all of the company’s earnings. Atthat time our directors will need to determine whether the best method to distribute the excess earnings isthrough dividends, share repurchases or both. If Berkshire shares are selling below intrinsic business value,massive repurchases will almost certainly be the best choice. You can be comfortable that your directorswill make the right decision.
‹No company will be more shareholder-minded than Berkshire. For more than 30 years, we have annuallyreaffirmed our Shareholder Principles (see page 117), always leading off with: “Although our form iscorporate, our attitude is partnership.” This covenant with you is etched in stone.We have an extraordinarily knowledgeable and business-oriented board of directors ready to carry out thatpromise of partnership. None took the job for the money: In an arrangement almost non-existent elsewhere,our directors are paid only token fees. They receive their rewards instead through ownership of Berkshireshares and the satisfaction that comes from being good stewards of an important enterprise.The shares that they and their families own – which, in many cases, are worth very substantial sums – werepurchasedin the market (rather than their materializing through options or grants). In addition, unlikealmost all other sizable public companies, we carry no directors and officers liability insurance. AtBerkshire, directors walk in your shoes.To further ensure continuation of our culture, I have suggested that my son, Howard, succeed me as a non- executiveChairman. My only reason for this wish is to make change easier if the wrong CEO should everbe employed and there occurs a need for the Chairman to move forcefully. I can assure you that thisproblem has averylow probability of arising at Berkshire – likely as low as at any public company. In myservice on the boards of nineteen public companies, however, I’ve seen how hard it is to replace a mediocreCEO if that person is also Chairman. (The deed usually gets done, but almost always very late.)If elected, Howard will receive no pay and will spend no time at the job other than that required of alldirectors. He will simply be a safety valve to whom any director can go if he or she has concerns about theCEO and wishes to learn if other directors are expressing doubts as well. Should multiple directors beapprehensive, Howard’s chairmanship will allow the matter to be promptly and properly addressed.
‹Choosing the right CEO is all-important and is a subject that commands much time at Berkshire boardmeetings. Managing Berkshire is primarily a job of capital allocation, coupled with the selection andretention of outstanding managers to captain our operating subsidiaries. Obviously, the job also requires thereplacement of a subsidiary’s CEO when that is called for. These duties require Berkshire’s CEO to be arational, calm and decisive individual who has a broad understanding of business and good insights intohuman behavior. It’s important as well that he knows his limits. (As Tom Watson, Sr. of IBM said, “I’m nogenius, but I’m smart in spots and I stay around those spots.”)Character is crucial: A Berkshire CEO must be “all in” for the company, not for himself. (I’m using malepronouns to avoid awkward wording, but gender should never decide who becomes CEO.) He can’t helpbut earn money far in excess of any possible need for it. But it’s important that neither ego nor avaricemotivate him to reach for pay matching his most lavishly-compensated peers, even if his achievements farexceed theirs. A CEO’s behavior has a huge impact on managers down the line: If it’s clear to them thatshareholders’ interests are paramount to him, they will, with few exceptions, also embrace that way ofthinking.36My successor will need one other particular strength: the ability to fight off the ABCs of business decay,which are arrogance, bureaucracy and complacency. When these corporate cancers metastasize, even thestrongest of companies can falter. The examples available to prove the point are legion, but to maintainfriendships I will exhume only cases from the distant past.In their glory days, General Motors, IBM, Sears Roebuck and U.S. Steel sat atop huge industries. Theirstrengths seemed unassailable. But the destructive behavior I deplored above eventually led each of them tofall to depths that their CEOs and directors had not long before thought impossible. Their one-timefinancial strength and their historical earning power proved no defense.Only a vigilant and determined CEO can ward off such debilitating forces as Berkshire grows ever larger.He must never forget Charlie’s plea: “Tell me where I’m going to die, so I’ll never go there.” If our non-economic values were to be lost, much of Berkshire’s economic value would collapse as well. “Tone at thetop” will be key to maintaining Berkshire’s special culture.Fortunately, the structure our future CEOs will need to be successful is firmly in place. The extraordinarydelegation of authority now existing at Berkshire is the ideal antidote to bureaucracy. In an operating sense,Berkshire is not a giant company but rather a collection of large companies. At headquarters, we havenever had a committee nor have we ever required our subsidiaries to submit budgets (though many usethem as an important internal tool). We don’t have a legal office nor departments that other companies takefor granted: human relations, public relations, investor relations, strategy, acquisitions, you name it.We do, of course, have an active audit function; no sense being a damned fool. To an unusual degree,however, we trust our managers to run their operations with a keen sense of stewardship. After all, theywere doing exactly that before we acquired their businesses. With only occasional exceptions, furthermore,our trust produces better results than would be achieved by streams of directives, endless reviews andlayers of bureaucracy. Charlie and I try to interact with our managers in a manner consistent with what wewould wish for, if the positions were reversed.
‹Our directors believe that our future CEOs should come from internal candidates whom the Berkshireboard has grown to know well. Our directors also believe that an incoming CEO should be relativelyyoung, so that he or she can have a long run in the job. Berkshire will operate best if its CEOs average wellover ten years at the helm. (It’s hard to teach a new dog old tricks.) And they are not likely to retire at 65either (or have you noticed?).In both Berkshire’s business acquisitions and large, tailored investment moves, it is important that ourcounterparties be both familiar with and feel comfortable with Berkshire’s CEO. Developing confidence ofthat sort and cementing relationships takes time. The payoff, though, can be huge.Both the board and I believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO – a successor ready toassume the job the day after I die or step down. In certain important respects, this person will do a betterjob than I am doing.
‹Investments will always be of great importance to Berkshire and will be handled by several specialists.They will report to the CEO because their investment decisions, in a broad way, will need to becoordinated with Berkshire’s operating and acquisition programs. Overall, though, our investmentmanagers will enjoy great autonomy. In this area, too, we are in fine shape for decades to come. ToddCombs and Ted Weschler, each of whom has spent several years on Berkshire’s investment team, are first-rate in all respects and can be of particular help to the CEO in evaluating acquisitions.All told, Berkshire is ideally positioned for life after Charlie and I leave the scene. We have the rightpeople in place – the right directors, managers and prospective successors to those managers. Our culture,furthermore, is embedded throughout their ranks. Our system is also regenerative. To a large degree, bothgood and bad cultures self-select to perpetuate themselves. For very good reasons, business owners andoperating managers with values similar to ours will continue to be attracted to Berkshire as a one-of-a-kindandpermanenthome.37‹I would be remiss if I didn’t salute another key constituency that makes Berkshire special: our shareholders.Berkshire truly has an owner base unlike that of any other giant corporation. That fact was demonstrated inspades at last year’s annual meeting, where the shareholders were offered a proxy resolution:RESOLVED: Whereas the corporation has more money than it needs and since the owners unlikeWarren are not multi billionaires, the board shall consider paying a meaningful annual dividend onthe shares.The sponsoring shareholder of that resolution never showed up at the meeting, so his motion was notofficially proposed. Nevertheless, the proxy votes had been tallied, and they were enlightening.Not surprisingly, the A shares – owned by relatively few shareholders, each with a large economic interest– voted “no” on the dividend question by a margin of 89 to 1.The remarkable vote was that of our B shareholders. They number in the hundreds of thousands – perhapseven totaling one million – and they voted 660,759,855 “no” and 13,927,026 “yes,” a ratio of about 47 to 1.Our directors recommended a “no” vote but the company did not otherwise attempt to influenceshareholders. Nevertheless, 98% of the shares voting said, in effect, “Don’t send us a dividend but insteadreinvest all of the earnings.” To have our fellow owners – large and small – be so in sync with ourmanagerial philosophy is both remarkable and rewarding.I am a lucky fellow to have you as partners.Warren E. Buffett
38Vice Chairman’s Thoughts – Past and FutureTo the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:I closely watched the 50-year history of Berkshire’s uncommon success under Warren Buffett. And it now seemsappropriate that I independently supplement whatever celebratory comment comes from him. I will try to do fivethings.(1) Describe the management system and policies that caused a small and unfixably-doomed commoditytextile business to morph into the mighty Berkshire that now exists,(2) Explain how the management system and policies came into being,(3) Explain, to some extent, why Berkshire did so well,(4) Predict whether abnormally good results would continue if Buffett were soon to depart, and(5) Consider whether Berkshire’s great results over the last 50 years have implications that may prove usefulelsewhere.The management system and policies of Berkshire under Buffett (herein together called “the Berkshire system”)were fixed early and are described below:(1) Berkshire would be a diffuse conglomerate, averse only to activities about which it could not make usefulpredictions.(2) Its top company would do almost all business through separately incorporated subsidiaries whose CEOswould operate with very extreme autonomy.(3) There would be almost nothing at conglomerate headquarters except a tiny office suite containing aChairman, a CFO, and a few assistants who mostly helped the CFO with auditing, internal control, etc.(4) Berkshire subsidiaries would always prominently include casualty insurers. Those insurers as a groupwould be expected to produce, in due course, dependable underwriting gains while also producingsubstantial “float” (from unpaid insurance liabilities) for investment.(5) There would be no significant system-wide personnel system, stock option system, other incentive system,retirement system, or the like, because the subsidiaries would have their own systems, often different.(6) Berkshire’s Chairman would reserve only a few activities for himself.(i) He would manage almost all security investments, with these normally residing in Berkshire’scasualty insurers.(ii) He would choose all CEOs of important subsidiaries, and he would fix their compensation andobtain from each a private recommendation for a successor in case one was suddenly needed.(iii) He would deploy most cash not needed in subsidiaries after they had increased their competitiveadvantage, with the ideal deployment being the use of that cash to acquire new subsidiaries.(iv) He would make himself promptly available for almost any contact wanted by any subsidiary’sCEO, and he would require almost no additional contact.(v) He would write a long, logical, and useful letter for inclusion in his annual report, designed as hewould wish it to be if he were only a passive shareholder, and he would be available for hours ofanswering questions at annual shareholders’ meetings.(vi) He would try to be an exemplar in a culture that would work well for customers, shareholders,and other incumbents for a long time, both before and after his departure.(vii) His first priority would be reservation of much time for quiet reading and thinking, particularlythat which might advance his determined learning, no matter how old he became; and39(viii) He would also spend much time in enthusiastically admiring what others were accomplishing.(7) New subsidiaries would usually be bought with cash, not newly issued stock.(8) Berkshire would not pay dividends so long as more than one dollar of market value for shareholders wasbeing created by each dollar of retained earnings.(9) In buying a new subsidiary, Berkshire would seek to pay a fair price for a good business that the Chairmancould pretty well understand. Berkshire would also want a good CEO in place, one expected to remain for along time and to manage well without need for help from headquarters.(10) In choosing CEOs of subsidiaries, Berkshire would try to secure trustworthiness, skill, energy, and love forthe business and circumstances the CEO was in.(11) As an important matter of preferred conduct, Berkshire would almost never sell a subsidiary.(12) Berkshire would almost never transfer a subsidiary’s CEO to another unrelated subsidiary.(13) Berkshire would never force the CEO of a subsidiary to retire on account of mere age.(14) Berkshire would have little debt outstanding as it tried to maintain (i) virtually perfect creditworthinessunder all conditions and (ii) easy availability of cash and credit for deployment in times presenting unusualopportunities.(15) Berkshire would always be user-friendly to a prospective seller of a large business. An offer of such abusiness would get prompt attention. No one but the Chairman and one or two others at Berkshire wouldever know about the offer if it did not lead to a transaction. And they would never tell outsiders about it.Both the elements of the Berkshire system and their collected size are quite unusual. No other large corporation Iknow of has half of such elements in place.How did Berkshire happen to get a corporate personality so different from the norm?Well, Buffett, even when only 34 years old, controlled about 45% of Berkshire’s shares and was completely trustedby all the other big shareholders. He could install whatever system he wanted. And he did so, creating the Berkshiresystem.Almost every element was chosen because Buffett believed that, under him, it would help maximize Berkshire’sachievement. He was not trying to create a one-type-fits-all system for other corporations. Indeed, Berkshire’ssubsidiaries were not required to use the Berkshire system in their own operations. And some flourished while usingdifferent systems.What was Buffett aiming at as he designed the Berkshire system?Well, over the years I diagnosed several important themes:(1) He particularly wanted continuous maximization of the rationality, skills, and devotion of the mostimportant people in the system, starting with himself.(2) He wanted win/win results everywhere--in gaining loyalty by giving it, for instance.(3) He wanted decisions that maximized long-term results, seeking these from decision makers who usuallystayed long enough in place to bear the consequences of decisions.(4) He wanted to minimize the bad effects that would almost inevitably come from a large bureaucracy atheadquarters.(5) He wanted to personally contribute, like Professor Ben Graham, to the spread of wisdom attained.When Buffett developed the Berkshire system, did he foresee all the benefits that followed? No. Buffett stumbled intosome benefits through practice evolution. But, when he saw useful consequences, he strengthened their causes.40Why did Berkshire under Buffett do so well?Only four large factors occur to me:(1) The constructive peculiarities of Buffett,(2) The constructive peculiarities of the Berkshire system,(3) Good luck, and(4) The weirdly intense, contagious devotion of some shareholders and other admirers, including some in thepress.I believe all four factors were present and helpful. But the heavy freight was carried by the constructivepeculiarities, the weird devotion, and their interactions.In particular, Buffett’s decision to limit his activities to a few kinds and to maximize his attention to them, and tokeep doing so for 50 years, was a lollapalooza. Buffett succeeded for the same reason Roger Federer became goodat tennis.Buffett was, in effect, using the winning method of the famous basketball coach, John Wooden, who won mostregularly after he had learned to assign virtually all playing time to his seven best players. That way, opponentsalways faced his best players, instead of his second best. And, with the extra playing time, the best players improvedmore than was normal.And Buffett much out-Woodened Wooden, because in his case the exercise of skill was concentrated in one person,not seven, and his skill improved and improved as he got older and older during 50 years, instead of deterioratinglike the skill of a basketball player does.Moreover, by concentrating so much power and authority in the often-long-serving CEOs of important subsidiaries,Buffett was also creating strong Wooden-type effects there. And such effects enhanced the skills of the CEOs andthe achievements of the subsidiaries.Then, as the Berkshire system bestowed much-desired autonomy on many subsidiaries and their CEOs, andBerkshire became successful and well known, these outcomes attracted both more and better subsidiaries intoBerkshire, and better CEOs as well.And the better subsidiaries and CEOs then required less attention from headquarters, creating what is often called a“virtuous circle.”How well did it work out for Berkshire to always include casualty insurers as important subsidiaries?Marvelously well. Berkshire’s ambitions were unreasonably extreme and, even so, it got what it wanted.Casualty insurers often invest in common stocks with a value amounting roughly to their shareholders’ equity, asdid Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries. And the S&P 500 Index produced about 10% per annum, pre-tax, during thelast 50 years, creating a significant tailwind.And, in the early decades of the Buffett era, common stocks within Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries greatlyoutperformed the index, exactly as Buffett expected. And, later, when both the large size of Berkshire’sstockholdings and income tax considerations caused the index-beating part of returns to fade to insignificance(perhaps not forever), other and better advantage came. Ajit Jain created out of nothing an immense reinsurancebusiness that produced both a huge “float” and a large underwriting gain. And all of GEICO came into Berkshire,followed by a quadrupling of GEICO’s market share. And the rest of Berkshire’s insurance operations hugelyimproved, largely by dint of reputational advantage, underwriting discipline, finding and staying within good niches,and recruiting and holding outstanding people.41Then, later, as Berkshire’s nearly unique and quite dependable corporate personality and large size became wellknown, its insurance subsidiaries got and seized many attractive opportunities, not available to others, to buyprivately issued securities. Most of these securities had fixed maturities and produced outstanding results.Berkshire’s marvelous outcome in insurance was not a natural result. Ordinarily, a casualty insurance business is aproducer of mediocre results, even when very well managed. And such results are of little use. Berkshire’s betteroutcome was so astoundingly large that I believe that Buffett would now fail to recreate it if he returned to a smallbase while retaining his smarts and regaining his youth.Did Berkshire suffer from being a diffuse conglomerate? No, its opportunities were usefully enlarged by a widenedarea for operation. And bad effects, common elsewhere, were prevented by Buffett’s skills.Why did Berkshire prefer to buy companies with cash, instead of its own stock? Well, it was hard to get anything inexchange for Berkshire stock that was as valuable as what was given up.Why did Berkshire’s acquisition of companies outside the insurance business work out so well for Berkshireshareholders when the normal result in such acquisitions is bad for shareholders of the acquirer?Well, Berkshire, by design, had methodological advantages to supplement its better opportunities. It never had theequivalent of a “department of acquisitions” under pressure to buy. And it never relied on advice from “helpers”sure to be prejudiced in favor of transactions. And Buffett held self-delusion at bay as he underclaimed expertisewhile he knew better than most corporate executives what worked and what didn’t in business, aided by his longexperience as a passive investor. And, finally, even when Berkshire was getting much better opportunities than mostothers, Buffett often displayed almost inhuman patience and seldom bought. For instance, during his first ten yearsin control of Berkshire, Buffett saw one business (textiles) move close to death and two new businesses come in, fora net gain of one.What were the big mistakes made by Berkshire under Buffett? Well, while mistakes of commission were common,almost all huge errors were in not making a purchase, including not purchasing Walmart stock when that was sure towork out enormously well. The errors of omission were of much importance. Berkshire’s net worth would now be atleast $50 billion higher if it had seized several opportunities it was not quite smart enough to recognize as virtuallysure things.The next to last task on my list was: Predict whether abnormally good results would continue at Berkshire if Buffettwere soon to depart.The answer is yes. Berkshire has in place in its subsidiaries much business momentum grounded in much durablecompetitive advantage.Moreover, its railroad and utility subsidiaries now provide much desirable opportunity to invest large sums in newfixed assets. And many subsidiaries are now engaged in making wise “bolt-on” acquisitions.Provided that most of the Berkshire system remains in place, the combined momentum and opportunity now presentis so great that Berkshire would almost surely remain a better-than-normal company for a very long time even if(1) Buffett left tomorrow, (2) his successors were persons of only moderate ability, and (3) Berkshire never againpurchased a large business.But, under this Buffett-soon-leaves assumption, his successors would not be “of only moderate ability.” Forinstance, Ajit Jain and Greg Abel are proven performers who would probably be under-described as “world-class.”“World-leading” would be the description I would choose. In some important ways, each is a better businessexecutive than Buffett.And I believe neither Jain nor Abel would (1) leave Berkshire, no matter what someone else offered or (2) desiremuch change in the Berkshire system.42Nor do I think that desirable purchases of new businesses would end with Buffett’s departure. With Berkshire nowso large and the age of activism upon us, I think some desirable acquisition opportunities will come and thatBerkshire’s $60 billion in cash will constructively decrease.My final task was to consider whether Berkshire’s great results over the last 50 years have implications that mayprove useful elsewhere.The answer is plainly yes. In its early Buffett years, Berkshire had a big task ahead: turning a tiny stash into a largeand useful company. And it solved that problem by avoiding bureaucracy and relying much on one thoughtful leaderfor a long, long time as he kept improving and brought in more people like himself.Compare this to a typical big-corporation system with much bureaucracy at headquarters and a long succession ofCEOs who come in at about age 59, pause little thereafter for quiet thought, and are soon forced out by a fixedretirement age.I believe that versions of the Berkshire system should be tried more often elsewhere and that the worst attributes ofbureaucracy should much more often be treated like the cancers they so much resemble. A good example ofbureaucracy fixing was created by George Marshall when he helped win World War II by getting from Congress theright to ignore seniority in choosing generals. Sincerely,Charles T. Munger

Starting in 1979,accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market rather than at the lower of cost or market, which waspreviously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire’s results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects , the results are calculated using the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-taxwhereas the Berkshire numbers areafter-tax.I fa corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return. Over theyears, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.
2BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:Berkshire’s gain in net worth during 2015 was $15.4 billion, which increased the per-share book value ofboth our Class A and Class B stock by 6.4%. Over the last 51 years (that is, since present management took over),per-share book value has grown from $19 to $155,501, a rate of 19.2% compounded annually.*During the first half of those years, Berkshire’s net worth was roughly equal to the number that reallycounts: the intrinsic value of the business. The similarity of the two figures existed then because most of ourresources were deployed in marketable securities that were regularly revalued to their quoted prices (less the tax thatwould be incurred if they were to be sold). In Wall Street parlance, our balance sheet was then in very large part“marked to market.”By the early 1990s, however, our focus had changed to the outright ownership of businesses, a shift thatdiminished the relevance of balance-sheet figures. That disconnect occurred because the accounting rules that applyto controlled companies are materially different from those used in valuing marketable securities. The carryingvalue of the “losers” we own is written down, but “winners” are neverrevalued upwards. We’ve had experience with both outcomes: I’ve made some dumb purchases, and the amount I paid for theeconomic goodwill of those companies was later written off, a move that reduced Berkshire’s book value. We’vealso had some winners – a few of them very big – but have not written those up by a penny.Over time, this asymmetrical accounting treatment (with which we agree) necessarily widens the gapbetween intrinsic value and book value. Today, the large – and growing – unrecorded gains at our “winners” make itclear that Berkshire’s intrinsic valuefarexceeds its book value. That’s why we would be delighted to repurchaseour shares should they sell as low as 120% of book value. At that level, purchases would instantly and meaningfullyincrease per-share intrinsic value for Berkshire’s continuing shareholders.The unrecorded increase in the value of our owned businesses explains why Berkshire’s aggregate market-value gain – tabulated on the facing page – materially exceeds our book-value gain. The two indicators varyerratically over short periods. Last year, for example, book-value performance was superior. Over time, however,market-value gains should continue their historical tendency to exceed gains in book value.* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500
thof those shown for A.3The Year at BerkshireCharlie Munger, Berkshire Vice Chairman and my partner, and I expect Berkshire’s normalizedearning power to increase every year. (Actualyear-to-year earnings, of course, will sometimes decline because of weaknessin the U.S. economy or, possibly, because of insurance mega-catastrophes.) In some years the normalized gains willbe small; at other times they will be material. Last year was a good one. Here are the highlights:
‹ The most important development at Berkshire during 2015 was not financial, though it led to betterearnings. After a poor performance in 2014, our BNSF railroad dramatically improved its service tocustomers last year. To attain that result, we invested about $5.8 billion during the year in capitalexpenditures, a sum far and away the record for any American railroad and nearly three times our annualdepreciation charge. It was money well spent.BNSF moves about 17% of America’s intercity freight (measured by revenue ton-miles), whethertransported by rail, truck, air, water or pipeline. In that respect, we are a strong number one among theseven large American railroads (two of which are Canadian-based), carrying 45% more ton-miles of freightthan our closest competitor. Consequently, our maintaining first-class service is not only vital to ourshippers’ welfare but also important to the smooth functioning of the U.S. economy.For most American railroads, 2015 was a disappointing year. Aggregate ton-miles fell, and earningsweakened as well. BNSF, however, maintained volume, and pre-tax income rose to a record $6.8 billion*(a gain of $606 million from 2014). Matt Rose and Carl Ice, the managers of BNSF, have my thanks anddeserve yours.
‹ BNSF is the largest of our “Powerhouse Five,” a group that also includes Berkshire Hathaway Energy,Marmon, Lubrizol and IMC. Combined, these companies – our five most profitable non-insurancebusinesses – earned $13.1 billion in 2015, an increase of $650 million over 2014.Of the five, only Berkshire Hathaway Energy, then earning $393 million, was owned by us in 2003.Subsequently, we purchased three of the other four on an all-cash basis. In acquiring BNSF, however, wepaid about 70% of the cost in cash and, for the remainder, issued Berkshire shares that increased thenumber outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $12.7 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshireby the five companies over the twelve-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. Thatsatisfies our goal of not simply increasing earnings, but making sure we also increase per-shareresults.
‹ Next year, I will be discussing the “Powerhouse Six.” The newcomer will be Precision Castparts Corp.(“PCC”), a business that we purchased a month ago for more than $32 billion of cash. PCC fits perfectlyinto the Berkshire model and will substantially increase our normalizedper-share earning power. Under CEO Mark Donegan, PCC has become the world’s premier supplier of aerospace components (mostof them destined to be original equipment, though spares are important to the company as well). Mark’saccomplishments remind me of the magic regularly performed by Jacob Harpaz at IMC, our remarkableIsraeli manufacturer of cutting tools. The two men transform very ordinary raw materials into extraordinaryproducts that are used by major manufacturers worldwide. Each is the da Vinci of his craft.PCC’s products, often delivered under multi-year contracts, are key components in most large aircraft.Other industries are served as well by the company’s 30,466 employees, who work out of 162 plants in 13countries. In building his business, Mark has made many acquisitions and will make more. We lookforward to having him deploy Berkshire’s capital.
* Throughout this letter, all earnings are stated on a pre-tax basis unless otherwise designated. 4A personal thank-you: The PCC acquisition would not have happened without the input and assistance ofour own Todd Combs, who brought the company to my attention a few years ago and went on to educateme about both the business and Mark. Though Todd and Ted Weschler are primarily investment managers– they each handle about $9 billion for us – both of them cheerfully and ably add major value to Berkshirein other ways as well. Hiring these two was one of my best moves.
‹With the PCC acquisition, Berkshire will own 101⁄4companies that would populate the Fortune 500 if they were stand-alone businesses. (Our 27% holding of Kraft Heinz is the
1⁄4.) That leaves just under 98% of America’s business giants that have yet to call us. Operators are standing by.
‹Our many dozens of smaller non-insurance businesses earned $5.7 billion last year, up from $5.1 billion in2014. Within this group, we have one company that last year earned more than $700 million, two thatearned between $400 million and $700 million, seven that earned between $250 million and $400 million,six that earned between $100 million and $250 million, and eleven that earned between $50 million and$100 million. We love them all: This collection of businesses will expand both in number and earnings asthe years go by.
‹When you hear talk about America’s crumbling infrastructure, rest assured that they’re not talking aboutBerkshire. We invested $16 billion in property, plant and equipment last year, a full 86% of it deployed inthe United States.I told you earlier about BNSF’s record capital expenditures in 2015. At the end of everyyear, our railroad’s physical facilities will be improved from those existing twelve months earlier.Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) is a similar story. That company has invested $16 billion inrenewables and now owns 7% of the country’s wind generation and 6% of its solar generation. Indeed, the4,423 megawatts of wind generation owned and operated by our regulated utilities is sixtimes the generation of the runner-up utility.We’re not done. Last year, BHE made major commitments to the future development of renewables insupport of the Paris Climate Change Conference. Our fulfilling those promises will make great sense, bothfor the environment and for Berkshire’s economics.
‹Berkshire’s huge and growing insurance operation again operated at an underwriting profit in 2015 – thatmakes 13 years in a row – and increased its float. During those years, our float – money that doesn’t belongto us but that we can invest for Berkshire’s benefit – grew from $41 billion to $88 billion. Though neitherthat gain nor the size of our float is reflected in Berkshire’s earnings, float generates significant investmentincome because of the assets it allows us to hold.Meanwhile, our underwriting profit totaled $26 billion during the 13-year period, including $1.8 billionearned in 2015. Without a doubt, Berkshire’s largest unrecorded wealth lies in its insurance business.We’ve spent 48 years building this multi-faceted operation, and it can’t be replicated.
‹While Charlie and I search for new businesses to buy, our many subsidiaries are regularly making bolt-onacquisitions. Last year we contracted for 29 bolt-ons, scheduled to cost $634 million in aggregate. The costof these purchases ranged from $300,000 to $143 million.Charlie and I encourage bolt-ons,ifthey are sensibly-priced. (Most deals offered us most definitely aren’t.)These purchases deploy capital in operations that fit with our existing businesses and that will be managedby our corps of expert managers. That means no additional work for us, yet more earnings for Berkshire, acombination we find highly appealing. We will make many dozens of bolt-on deals in future years.
5‹Our Heinz partnership with Jorge Paulo Lemann, Alex Behring and Bernardo Hees more than doubled itssize last year by merging with Kraft. Before this transaction, we owned about 53% of Heinz at a cost of$4.25 billion. Now we own 325.4 million shares of Kraft Heinz (about 27%) that cost us $9.8 billion. Thenew company has annual sales of $27 billion and can supply you Heinz ketchup or mustard to go with yourOscar Mayer hot dogs that come from the Kraft side. Add a Coke, and you will be enjoying my favoritemeal. (We will have the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile at the annual meeting – bring your kids.)Though we sold no Kraft Heinz shares, “GAAP” (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) required usto record a $6.8 billion write-up of our investment upon completion of the merger. That leaves us with ourKraft Heinz holding carried on our balance sheet at a value many billions above our cost and many billionsbelow its market value, an outcome only an accountant could love.Berkshire also owns Kraft Heinz preferred shares that pay us $720 million annually and are carried at $7.7billion on our balance sheet. That holding will almost certainly be redeemed for $8.32 billion in June (theearliest date allowed under the preferred’s terms). That will be good news for Kraft Heinz and bad news forBerkshire.Jorge Paulo and his associates could not be better partners. We share with them a passion to buy, build andholdlarge businesses that satisfy basic needs and desires. We follow different paths, however, in pursuingthis goal.Their method, at which they have been extraordinarily successful, is to buy companies that offer anopportunity for eliminating many unnecessary costs and then – very promptly –to make the moves that will get the job done. Their actions significantly boost productivity, the all-important factor in America’seconomic growth over the past 240 years. Without more output of desired goods and services per workinghour – that’s the measure of productivity gains – an economy inevitably stagnates. At much of corporateAmerica, truly major gains in productivity are possible, a fact offering opportunities to Jorge Paulo and hisassociates.At Berkshire, we, too, crave efficiency and detest bureaucracy. To achieve our goals, however, we followan approach emphasizingavoidanceof bloat, buying businesses such as PCC that have long been run bycost-conscious and efficient managers. After the purchase, ourrole is simply to create an environment in which these CEOs – and their eventual successors, who typically are like-minded – can maximize boththeir managerial effectiveness and the pleasure they derive from their jobs. (With this hands-off style, I amheeding a well-known Mungerism: “If you want to guarantee yourself a lifetime of misery, be sure tomarry someone with the intent of changing their behavior.”)We will continue to operate with extreme – indeed, almost unheard of – decentralization at Berkshire. Butwe will also look for opportunities to partner with Jorge Paulo, either as a financing partner, as was thecase when his group purchased Tim Horton’s, or as a combined equity-and-financing partner, as at Heinz.We also may occasionally partner with others, as we have successfully done at Berkadia.Berkshire, however, will join only with partners making friendly acquisitions. To be sure, certain hostileoffers are justified: Some CEOs forget that it is shareholders for whom they should be working, while othermanagers are woefully inept. In either case, directors may be blind to the problem or simply reluctant tomake the change required. That’s when new faces are needed. We, though, will leave these “opportunities”for others. At Berkshire, we go only where we are welcome.
6‹Berkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its “Big Four” investments – AmericanExpress, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. We purchased additional shares of IBM (increasing ourownership to 8.4% versus 7.8% at yearend 2014) and Wells Fargo (going to 9.8% from 9.4%). At the othertwo companies, Coca-Cola and American Express, stock repurchases raised our percentage ownership. Ourequity in Coca-Cola grew from 9.2% to 9.3%, and our interest in American Express increased from 14.8%to 15.6%. In case you think these seemingly small changes aren’t important, consider this math: For thefour companies in aggregate, each increase of one percentage point in our ownership raises Berkshire’sportion of their annual earnings by about $500 million.These four investees possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented andshareholder-oriented. Their returns on tangible equity range from excellent to staggering. At Berkshire, wemuch prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of a wonderful company to owning 100% ofa so-so business. It’s better to have a partial interest in the Hope Diamond than to own all of a rhinestone.If Berkshire’s yearend holdings are used as the marker, our portion of the “Big Four’s” 2015 earningsamounted to $4.7 billion. In the earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends theypay us – about $1.8 billion last year. But make no mistake: The nearly $3 billion of these companies’earnings we don’t report are every bit as valuable to us as the portion Berkshire records.The earnings our investees retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock – a move that increasesBerkshire’s share of future earnings without requiring us to lay out a dime. The retained earnings of thesecompanies also fund business opportunities that usually turn out to be advantageous. All that leads us toexpect that the per-share earnings of these four investees, in aggregate, will grow substantially over time. Ifgains do indeed materialize, dividends to Berkshire will increase and so, too, will our unrealized capitalgains.Our flexibility in capital allocation – our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlledbusinesses – gives us a significant edge over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they willoperate. Woody Allen once explained that the advantage of being bi-sexual is that it doubles your chanceof finding a date on Saturday night. In like manner – well, not exactly like manner – our appetite for eitheroperating businesses or passive investments doubles ourchances of finding sensible uses for Berkshire’s endless gusher of cash. Beyond that, having a huge portfolio of marketable securities gives us a stockpileof funds that can be tapped when an elephant-sized acquisition is offered to us.************It’s an election year, and candidates can’t stop speaking about our country’s problems (which, of course,onlytheycan solve). As a result of this negative drumbeat, many Americans now believe that their children will notlive as well as they themselves do.That view is dead wrong: The babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history.American GDP per capita is now about $56,000. As I mentioned last year that – in real terms –is a staggering six times the amount in 1930, the year I was born, a leap far beyond the wildest dreams of my parents ortheir contemporaries. U.S. citizens are not intrinsically more intelligent today, nor do they work harder than didAmericans in 1930. Rather, they work far more efficiently and thereby produce far more. This all-powerful trend iscertain to continue: America’s economic magic remains alive and well.Some commentators bemoan our current 2% per year growth in real GDP – and, yes, we would all like tosee a higher rate. But let’s do some simple math using the much-lamented 2% figure. That rate, we will see, deliversastounding gains.
7America’s population is growing about .8% per year (.5% from births minus deaths and .3% from netmigration). Thus 2% ofoverallgrowth produces about 1.2% ofper capitagrowth. That may not sound impressive. But in a single generation of, say, 25 years, that rate of growth leads to a gain of 34.4% in realGDP per capita. (Compounding’s effects produce the excess over the percentage that would result by simply multiplying 25 x 1.2%.)In turn, that 34.4% gain will produce a staggering $19,000 increase in real GDP per capitafor the next generation. Were that to be distributed equally, the gain would be $76,000 annually for a family of four. Today’s politiciansneed not shed tears for tomorrow’s children.Indeed, most oftoday’schildren are doing well.Allfamilies in my upper middle-class neighborhood regularly enjoy a living standard better than that achieved by John D. Rockefeller Sr. at the time of my birth. Hisunparalleled fortune couldn’t buy what we now take for granted, whether the field is – to name just a few –transportation, entertainment, communication or medical services. Rockefeller certainly had power and fame; hecould not, however, live as well as my neighbors now do.Though the pie to be shared by the next generation will be farlarger than today’s, how it will be divided will remain fiercely contentious. Just as is now the case, there will be struggles for the increased output of goodsand services between those people in their productive years and retirees, between the healthy and the infirm,between the inheritors and the Horatio Algers, between investors and workers and, in particular, between those withtalents that are valued highly by the marketplace and the equally decent hard-working Americans who lack the skillsthe market prizes. Clashes of that sort have forever been with us – and will forever continue. Congress will be thebattlefield; money and votes will be the weapons. Lobbying will remain a growth industry.The good news, however, is that even members of the “losing” sides will almost certainly enjoy – as they should– far more goods and services in the future than they have in the past. The quality of their increased bountywill also dramatically improve. Nothing rivals the market system in producing what people want – nor, even moreso, in delivering what people don’t yet know they want. My parents, when young, could not envision a televisionset, nor did I, in my 50s, think I needed a personal computer. Both products, once people saw what they could do,quickly revolutionized their lives. I now spend ten hours a week playing bridge online. And, as I write this letter,“search” is invaluable to me. (I’m not ready for Tinder, however.)For 240 years it’s been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start. America’sgolden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs. America’s social securitypromises will be honored and perhaps made more generous. And, yes, America’s kids will live far better than theirparents did.************Considering this favorable tailwind, Berkshire (and, to be sure, a great many other businesses) will almostcertainly prosper. The managers who succeed Charlie and me will build Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic value byfollowing our simple blueprint of: (1) constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries;(2) further increasing their earnings through bolt-on acquisitions; (3) benefiting from the growth of our investees;(4) repurchasing Berkshire shares when they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value; and(5) making an occasional large acquisition. Management will also try to maximize results for youby rarely, if ever, issuing Berkshire shares.
8Intrinsic Business ValueAs much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that numberis for Berkshire shares (nor, in fact, for any other stock). It is possible, however, to make a sensible estimate. In our2010 annual report we laid out the three elements – one of them qualitative – that we believe are the keys to anestimation of Berkshire’s intrinsic value. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 113-114.Here is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2015 our per-share cash and investments increased8.3% to $159,794 (with our Kraft Heinz shares stated at market value), and earnings from our many businesses –including insurance underwriting income –increased 2.1% to $12,304 per share. We exclude in the second factorthe dividends and interest from the investments we hold because including them would produce a double-countingof value. In arriving at our earnings figure, we deduct all corporate overhead, interest, depreciation, amortizationand minority interests. Income taxes, though, are not deducted. That is, the earnings are pre-tax . I used the italics in the paragraph above because we are for the first time including insurance underwritingincome in business earnings. We did not do that when we initially introduced Berkshire’s two quantitative pillars ofvaluation because our insurance results were then heavily influenced by catastrophe coverages. If the wind didn’tblow and the earth didn’t shake, we made large profits. But a mega-catastrophe would produce red ink. In order tobe conservative then in stating our business earnings, we consistently assumed that underwriting would break evenover time and ignored any of its gains or losses in our annual calculation of the second factor of value.Today, our insurance results are likely to be more stable than was the case a decade or two ago because wehave deemphasized catastrophe coverages and greatly expanded our bread-and-butter lines of business. Last year,our underwriting income contributed $1,118 per share to the $12,304 per share of earnings referenced in the secondparagraph of this section. Over the past decade, annual underwriting income has averaged $1,434 per share, and weanticipate being profitable in most years. You should recognize, however, that underwriting in any given year couldwell be unprofitable, perhaps substantially so.Since 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 18.9% compounded annually, and ourearnings (includingthe underwriting results in both the initial and terminal year) have grown at a 23.7% clip. It is nocoincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the ensuing 45 years has increased at a rate very similar to that ofour two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains in both sectors, but our main goal is to build operatingearnings.************Now, let’s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet andincome characteristics from the others. So we’ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie andI view them (though there are important andenduringeconomic advantages to having them all under one roof). Our intent is to provide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you beingthe reporting manager and we the absentee shareholders. (Don’t get excited; this is not a switch we are considering.)InsuranceLet’s look first at insurance. The property-casualty (“P/C”) branch of that industry has been the engine thathas propelled our expansion since 1967, when we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, NationalFire & Marine, for $8.6 million. Today, National Indemnity is the largest property-casualty company in the world,as measured by net worth. Moreover, its intrinsic value is farin excess of the value at which it is carried on our books.
9One reason we were attracted to the P/C business was its financial characteristics: P/C insurers receivepremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certain workers’ compensationaccidents, payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companiesholding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest thisfloat for their own benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holdsusually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float.Andhowwe have grown, as the following table shows:Year
Float (in millions)
1970 $ 391980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322015 87,722Further gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO and several of our specializedoperations are almost certain to grow at a good clip. National Indemnity’s reinsurance division, however, is party toa number of run-off contracts whose float drifts downward. If we do in time experience a decline in float, it will beverygradual – at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we canneverbe subject to immediate or near-term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. Thisstructure is by design and is a key component in the strength of Berkshire’s economic fortress. It will neverbe compromised.If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profitthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money– and, better yet, getpaidfor holding it.Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorousindeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insuranceindustry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning subnormalreturns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses. The prolonged period of low interest ratesthe world is now dealing with also virtually guarantees that earnings on float will steadily decrease for many yearsto come, thereby exacerbating the profit problems of insurers. It’s a good bet that industry results over the next tenyears will fall short of those recorded in the past decade, particularly for those companies that specialize inreinsurance.As noted early in this report, Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for 13 consecutiveyears, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $26.2 billion. That’s no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation isthe daily focus ofallof our insurance managers, who know that while float is valuable, its benefits can be drownedby poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service. At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testamentstyle.So how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire’s bookvalue is calculated, thefullamount of our float is deducted as aliability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to think offloat as strictly a liability is incorrect. It should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claims andrelated expenses – a huge $24.5 billion to more than six million claimants in 2015 – and that reduces float. Just assurely, we each day write new business that will soon generate its own claims, adding to float.
10If our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of thisliability isdramaticallyless than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises –because new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute – is worlds different from owing $1 that will go out thedoor tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities, however, are treated as equals under GAAP.A partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion “goodwill” asset that we incurred in buying ourinsurance companies and that increases book value. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paid forthe float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing on its true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, anygoodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.Fortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of ourinsurance goodwill – what we would happily pay for float of similar qualitywere we to purchase an insurance operation possessing it – to befarin excess of its historic carrying value. Indeed, almost the entire $15.5 billion wecarry for goodwill in our insurance business was already on our books in 2000. Yet we subsequently tripledour float. Its value today is one reason – a huge reason – why we believe Berkshire’s intrinsic business valuesubstantially exceeds its book value.************Berkshire’s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers runningdisciplined operations that possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risksthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks thatare inappropriate in relation to our resources.Indeed, Berkshire isfarmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if theinsurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe – a loss about triple anythingit has ever experienced – Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of itsmany streams of earnings. We would also remain awash in cash and be looking for large opportunities to writebusiness in an insurance market that might well be in disarray. Meanwhile, other major insurers and reinsurerswould be swimming in red ink, if not facing insolvency.When Ajit entered Berkshire’s office on a Saturday in 1986, he did not have a day’s experience in theinsurance business. Nevertheless, Mike Goldberg, then our manager of insurance, handed him the keys to ourreinsurance business. With that move, Mike achieved sainthood: Since then, Ajit has created tens of billions ofvalue for Berkshire shareholders.************We have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all exposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actuallycausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after bothprospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriatepremium can’t be obtained.
11Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can’t turn their back on businessthat is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, “The other guy is doing it, so we must as well,”spells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance.Tad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re’s hugefloat has been considerably better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, to continue.We are particularly enthusiastic about General Re’s international life reinsurance business, which has grownconsistently and profitably since we acquired the company in 1998.It can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, it was beset by problems that causedcommentators – and me as well, briefly – to believe I had made a huge mistake. That day is long gone. General Reis now a gem.************Finally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 65 years ago. GEICO is managed by TonyNicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 54 years of service in 2015. Tony became CEO in 1993, andsince then the company has been flying. There is nobetter manager than Tony. In the 40 years that I’ve known him, his every action has made great sense.When I was first introduced to GEICO in January 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage thecompany enjoyed compared to the expenses borne by the giants of the industry. It was clear to me that GEICOwould succeed because itdeservedto succeed.No onelikesto buy auto insurance. Almost everyone, though, likes to drive. The insurance consequentlyneeded is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them – and onlya low-cost operation can deliver these. Indeed, at least 40% of the people reading this letter can save money by insuring with GEICO. So stopreading – right now! – and go to geico.com or call 800-368-2734.GEICO’s cost advantage is the factor that has enabled the company to gobble up market share year afteryear. (We ended 2015 with 11.4% of the market compared to 2.5% in 1995, when Berkshire acquired control ofGEICO.) The company’s low costs create a moat – an enduringone – that competitors are unable to cross. All the while, our gecko never tires of telling Americans how GEICO can save them important money. Ilove hearing the little guy deliver his message: “15 minutes could save you 15% or more on car insurance.” (Ofcourse, there’s always a grouch in the crowd. One of my friends says he is glad that only a few animals can talk,since the ones that do speak seem unable to discuss any subject but insurance.)************In addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies that primarilywrite commercial coverages. In aggregate, these companies are a large, growing and valuable operation thatconsistently delivers an underwriting profit, usually much better than that reported by their competitors. Indeed,over the past 13 years, this group has earned $4 billion from underwriting – about 13% of its premium volume –while increasing its float from $943 million to $9.9 billion.Less than three years ago, we formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BHSI”), which we includein this group. Our first decision was to put Peter Eastwood in charge. That move was a home run: BHSI has alreadydeveloped $1 billion of annual premium volume and, under Peter’s direction, is destined to become one of theworld’s leading P/C insurers.

Berkshire’s great managers, premier financial strength and a variety of business models protected by widemoats amount to something unique in the insurance world. This assemblage of strengths is a huge asset forBerkshire shareholders that will only get more valuable with time.Regulated, Capital-Intensive BusinessesWe have two major operations, BNSF and BHE, that share important characteristics distinguishing themfrom our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section in this letter and split out their combinedfinancial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement. Together, they last year accounted for 37% ofBerkshire’s after-tax operating earnings.A key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, withthese partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact not needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions would far exceedits interest requirements. Last year, for example, in a disappointing year for railroads, BNSF’s interest coverage wasmore than 8:1. (Our definition of coverage is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest, notEBITDA/ interest, a commonly used measure we view as seriously flawed.)At BHE, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company’s ability to service its debt under all circumstances.The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companies offering anessential service on an exclusive basis. The second is enjoyed by few other utilities: a great and ever-wideningdiversity of earnings streams, which shield BHE from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body. Thesemany sources of profit, supplemented by the inherent advantage of being owned by a strong parent, have allowedBHE and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower their cost of debt. This economic fact benefits both us andour customers.All told, BHE and BNSF invested $11.6 billion in plant and equipment last year, a massive commitment tokey components of America’s infrastructure. We relish making such investments as long as they promise reasonablereturns – and, on that front, we put a large amount of trust in future regulation.Our confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever needhuge investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capital providersin a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is concomitantly in our self-interestto conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent.Low prices are a powerful way to keep these constituencies happy. In Iowa, BHE’s average retail rate is6.8¢ per KWH. Alliant, the other major electric utility in the state, averages 9.5¢. Here are the comparable industryfigures for adjacent states: Nebraska 9.0¢, Missouri 9.3¢, Illinois 9.3¢, Minnesota 9.7¢. The national average is10.4¢. Our rock-bottom prices add up to real money for paycheck-strapped customers.
13At BNSF, price comparisons between major railroads are far more difficult to make because of significantdifferences in both their mix of cargo and the average distance it is carried. To supply a verycrude measure, however, our revenue per ton-mile was just under 3¢ last year, while shipping costs for customers of the other fourmajor U.S.-based railroads were at least 40% higher, ranging from 4.2¢ to 5.3¢.Both BHE and BNSF have been leaders in pursuing planet-friendly technology. In wind generation, nostate comes close to Iowa, where last year megawatt-hours we generated from wind equaled 47% of allmegawatt-hours sold to our retail customers. (Additional wind projects to which we are committed will take thatfigure to 58% in 2017.)BNSF, like other Class I railroads, uses only a single gallon of diesel fuel to move a ton of freight almost500 miles. That makes the railroads four times as fuel-efficient as trucks! Furthermore, railroads alleviate highwaycongestion – and the taxpayer-funded maintenance expenditures that come with heavier traffic – in a major way.Here are the key figures for BHE and BNSF:Berkshire Hathaway Energy (89.9% owned)

* Earnings for 2013 have been restated to exclude Marmon’s leasing operations, which are now included in theFinance and Financial Products results.Our income and expense data conforming to GAAP is on page 38. In contrast, the operating expensefigures above are non-GAAP because they exclude some purchase-accounting items (primarily the amortization ofcertain intangible assets). We present the data in this manner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbersmore accurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businesses aggregated in the table than doGAAP figures.I won’t explain all of the adjustments – some are tiny and arcane – but serious investors should understandthe disparate nature of intangible assets. Some truly deplete in value over time, while others in no waylose value. For software, as a big example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Conversely, the concept of recordingcharges against other intangibles, such as customer relationships, arises from purchase-accounting rules and clearlydoes not reflect economic reality. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both,that is, are recorded as expenses when earnings are calculated – even though, from an investor’s viewpoint, theycould not differ more.
15In the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 38, amortization charges of $1.1 billion have beendeducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these “real,” the rest not. The “non-real” charges, once non-existent at Berkshire, have become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. Non-realamortization charges are likely to climb further as we acquire more companies.The table on page 55 gives you the current status of our intangible assets as calculated by GAAP. We nowhave $6.8 billion left of amortizable intangibles, of which $4.1 billion will be expensed over the next five years.Eventually, of course, every dollar of these “assets” will be charged off. When that happens, reported earningsincrease even if true earnings are flat. (My gift to my successor.)I suggest that you ignore a portion of GAAP amortization costs. But it is with some trepidation that I dothat, knowing that it has become common for managers to tell their owners to ignore certain expense items that areall too real. “Stock-based compensation” is the most egregious example. The very name says it all: “compensation.”If compensation isn’t an expense, what is it? And, if real and recurring expenses don’t belong in the calculation ofearnings, where in the world do they belong?Wall Street analysts often play their part in this charade, too, parroting the phony, compensation-ignoring“earnings” figures fed them by managements. Maybe the offending analysts don’t know any better. Or maybe theyfear losing “access” to management. Or maybe they are cynical, telling themselves that since everyone else isplaying the game, why shouldn’t they go along with it. Whatever their reasoning, these analysts are guilty ofpropagating misleading numbers that can deceive investors.Depreciation charges are a more complicated subject but are almost always true costs. Certainly they are atBerkshire. I wish we could keep our businesses competitive while spending less than our depreciation charge, but in51 years I’ve yet to figure out how to do so. Indeed, the depreciation charge we record in our railroad business fallsfar short of the capital outlays needed to merely keep the railroad running properly, a mismatch that leads to GAAPearnings that are higher than true economic earnings. (This overstatement of earnings exists at all railroads.) WhenCEOs or investment bankers tout pre-depreciation figures such as EBITDA as a valuation guide, watch their noseslengthen while they speak.Our public reports of earnings will, of course, continue to conform to GAAP. To embrace reality, however,you should remember to add back most of the amortization charges we report. You should also subtract somethingto reflect BNSF’s inadequate depreciation charge.************Let’s get back to our many manufacturing, service and retailing operations, which sell products rangingfrom lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of this sector’s businesses, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets, enjoy terrific economics, producing profits that run from 25% after-tax to far more than 100%. Othersgenerate good returns in the area of 12% to 20%.A few, however – these are serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation – have very poorreturns. In most of these cases, I was wrong in my evaluation of the economic dynamics of the company or theindustry in which it operates, and we are now paying the price for my misjudgments. At other times, I stumbled inevaluating either the fidelity or the ability of incumbent managers or ones I later appointed. I will commit moreerrors; you can count on that. If we luck out, they will occur at our smaller operations.Viewed as a single entity, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employed an averageof $25.6 billion of net tangible assets during 2015 and, despite their holding large quantities of excess cash andusing only token amounts of leverage, earned 18.4% after-tax on that capital.
16Of course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if it is bought at too high a price. Wehave paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the largefigure we show for goodwill and other intangibles. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capitalwe have deployed in this sector. Earnings from the group should grow substantially in 2016 as Duracell andPrecision Castparts enter the fold.************We have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, theircompetitors – both current and potential – read this report. In a few of our businesses we might be disadvantaged ifothers knew our numbers. In some of our operations that are not of a size material to an evaluation of Berkshire,therefore, we only disclose what is required. You can nevertheless find a good bit of detail about many of ouroperations on pages 88-91.Finance and Financial ProductsOur three leasing and rental operations are conducted by CORT (furniture), XTRA (semi-trailers), andMarmon (primarily tank cars but also freight cars, intermodal tank containers and cranes). These companies areindustry leaders and have substantially increased their earnings as the American economy has gained strength. Ateach of the three, we have invested more money in new equipment than have many of our competitors, and that’spaid off. Dealing from strength is one of Berkshire’s enduring advantages.Kevin Clayton has again delivered an industry-leading performance at Clayton Homes, the second-largesthome builder in America. Last year, the company sold 34,397 homes, about 45% of the manufactured homes boughtby Americans. In contrast, the company was number three in the field, with a 14% share, when Berkshire purchasedit in 2003.Manufactured homes allow the American dream of home ownership to be achieved by lower-incomecitizens: Around 70% of new homes costing $150,000 or less come from our industry. About 46% of Clayton’shomes are sold through the 331 stores we ourselves own and operate. Most of Clayton’s remaining sales are made to1,395 independent retailers.Key to Clayton’s operation is its $12.8 billion mortgage portfolio. We originate about 35% of all mortgages on manufactured homes. About 37% of our mortgage portfolio emanates from our retail operation, withthe balance primarily originated by independent retailers, some of which sell our homes while others market onlythe homes of our competitors.Lenders other than Clayton have come and gone. With Berkshire’s backing, however, Clayton steadfastlyfinanced home buyers throughout the panic days of 2008-2009. Indeed, during that period, Clayton used preciouscapital to finance dealers who didnotsell our homes. The funds we supplied to Goldman Sachs and General Electricat that time produced headlines; the funds Berkshire quietly delivered to Clayton both made home ownershippossible for thousands of families and kept many non-Clayton dealers alive.Our retail outlets, employing simple language and large type, consistently inform home buyers ofalternative sources for financing – most of it coming from local banks – and always secure acknowledgments fromcustomers that this information has been received and read. (The form we use is reproduced in its actual size onpage 119.)
17Mortgage-origination practices are of great importance to both the borrower and to society. There is noquestion that reckless practices in home lending played a major role in bringing on the financial panic of 2008,which in turn led to the Great Recession. In the years preceding the meltdown, a destructive and often corruptpattern of mortgage creation flourished whereby (1) an originator in, say, California would make loans and(2) promptly sell them to an investment or commercial bank in, say, New York, which would package manymortgages to serve as collateral for a dizzyingly complicated array of mortgage-backed securities to be (3) sold tounwitting institutions around the world.As if these sins weren’t sufficient to create an unholy mess, imaginative investment bankers sometimesconcocted a second layer of sliced-up financing whose value depended on the junkier portions of primary offerings.(When Wall Street gets “innovative,” watch out!) While that was going on, I described this “doubling-up” practiceas requiring an investor to read tens of thousands of pages of mind-numbing prose to evaluate a single securitybeing offered.Both the originator and the packager of these financings had no skin in the game and were driven byvolume and mark-ups. Many housing borrowers joined the party as well, blatantly lying on their loan applicationswhile mortgage originators looked the other way. Naturally, the gamiest credits generated the most profits. SmoothWall Street salesmen garnered millions annually by manufacturing products that their customers were unable tounderstand. (It’s also questionable as to whether the major rating agencies were capable of evaluating the morecomplex structures. But rate them they did.)Barney Frank, perhaps the most financially-savvy member of Congress during the panic, recently assessedthe 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, saying, “The one major weakness that I’ve seen in the implementation was this decisionby the regulators not to impose risk retention on all residential mortgages.” Today, some legislators andcommentators continue to advocate a 1%-to-5% retention by the originator as a way to align its interests with that ofthe ultimate lender or mortgage guarantor.At Clayton, our risk retention was, and is, 100%. When we originate a mortgage we keep it (leaving asidethe few that qualify for a government guarantee). When we make mistakes in granting credit, we therefore pay aprice – a hefty price that dwarfs any profit we realized upon the original sale of the home. Last year we had toforeclose on 8,444 manufactured-housing mortgages at a cost to us of $157 million.The average loan we made in 2015 was only $59,942, small potatoes for traditional mortgage lenders, but adaunting commitment for our many lower-income borrowers. Our buyer acquires a decent home – take a look at thehome we will have on display at our annual meeting – requiring monthly principal-and-interest payments thataverage $522.Some borrowers, of course, will lose their jobs, and there will be divorces and deaths. Others will get over-extended on credit cards and mishandle their finances. We will lose money then, and our borrower will lose hisdown payment (though his mortgage payments during his time of occupancy may have been well under rental ratesfor comparable quarters). Nevertheless, despite the low FICO scores and income of our borrowers, their paymentbehavior during the Great Recession wasfarbetter than that prevailing in many mortgage pools populated by peopleearning multiples of our typical borrower’s income.The strong desire of our borrowers to have a home of their own is one reason we’ve done well with ourmortgage portfolio. Equally important, we have financed much of the portfolio with floating-rate debt or with short-term fixed-rate debt. Consequently, the incredibly low short-term rates of recent years have provided us aconstantly-widening spread between our interest costs and the income we derive from our mortgage portfolio, whichbears fixed rates. (Incidentally, we would have enjoyed similar margins had we simply bought long-term bonds andfinanced the position in some short-term manner.)
18Normally, it is risky business to lend long at fixed rates and borrow short as we have been doing atClayton. Over the years, some important financial institutions have gone broke doing that. At Berkshire, however,we possess a natural offset in that our businesses always maintain at least $20 billion in cash-equivalents that earn short-term rates. More often, our short-term investments are in the $40 billion to $60 billion range. If we have, say,$60 billion invested at
1⁄4% or less, a sharp move to higher short-term rates would bring benefits to us far exceedingthe higher financing costs we would incur in funding Clayton’s $13 billion mortgage portfolio. In banking terms,Berkshire is – and always will be – heavily asset-sensitive and will consequently benefit from rising interest rates.Let me talk about one subject of which I am particularly proud, that having to do with regulation. TheGreat Recession caused mortgage originators, servicers and packagers to come under intense scrutiny and to beassessed many billions of dollars in fines and penalties.The scrutiny has certainly extended to Clayton, whose mortgage practices have been continuouslyreviewed and examined in respect to such items as originations, servicing, collections, advertising, compliance, andinternal controls. At the federal level, we answer to the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Housing andUrban Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Dozens of states regulate us as well. During thepast two years, indeed, various federal and state authorities (from 25 states) examined and reviewed Clayton and itsmortgages on 65 occasions. The result? Our total fines during this period were $38,200 and our refunds to customers$704,678. Furthermore, though we had to foreclose on 2.64% of our manufactured-home mortgages last year,95.4% of our borrowers were current on their payments at yearend, as they moved toward owning a debt-free home.************Marmon’s rail fleet expanded to 133,220 units by yearend, a number significantly increased by thecompany’s purchase of 25,085 cars from General Electric on September 30. If our fleet was connected to form asingle train, the engine would be in Omaha and the caboose in Portland, Maine.At yearend, 97% of our railcars were leased, with about 15-17% of the fleet coming up for renewal eachyear. Though “tank cars” sound like vessels carrying crude oil, only about 7% of our fleet carries that product;chemicals and refined petroleum products are the lead items we transport. When trains roll by, look for the UTLX orProcor markings that identify our tank cars. When you spot the brand, puff out your chest; you own a portion of thatcar.Here’s the earnings recap for this sector: 2015

20Productivity and ProsperityEarlier, I told you how our partners at Kraft Heinz root out inefficiencies, thereby increasing output perhour of employment. That kind of improvement has been the secret sauce of America’s remarkable gains in livingstandards since the nation’s founding in 1776. Unfortunately, the label of “secret” is appropriate: Too fewAmericans fully grasp the linkage between productivity and prosperity. To see that connection, let’s look first at thecountry’s most dramatic example – farming – and later examine three Berkshire-specific areas.In 1900, America’s civilian work force numbered 28 million. Of these, 11 million, a staggering 40% of thetotal, worked in farming. The leading crop then, as now, was corn. About 90 million acres were devoted to itsproduction and the yield per acre was 30 bushels, for a total output of 2.7 billion bushels annually.Then came the tractor and one innovation after another that revolutionized such keys to farm productivityas planting, harvesting, irrigation, fertilization and seed quality. Today, we devote about 85 million acres to corn.Productivity, however, has improved yields to more than 150 bushels per acre, for an annual output of 13-14 billionbushels. Farmers have made similar gains with other products.Increased yields, though, are only half the story: The huge increases in physical output have beenaccompanied by a dramatic reduction in the number of farm laborers (“human input”). Today about three millionpeople work on farms, a tiny 2% of our 158-million-person work force. Thus, improved farming methods haveallowed tens of millions of present-day workers to utilize their time and talents in other endeavors, a reallocation ofhuman resources that enables Americans of today to enjoy huge quantities of non-farmgoods and services they would otherwise lack.It’s easy to look back over the 115-year span and realize how extraordinarily beneficial agriculturalinnovations have been – not just for farmers but, more broadly, for our entire society. We would not have anythingclose to the America we now know had we stifled those improvements in productivity. (It was fortunate that horsescouldn’t vote.) On a day-to-day basis, however, talk of the “greater good” must have rung hollow to farm hands wholost their jobs to machines that performed routine tasks far more efficiently than humans ever could. We willexamine this flip-side to productivity gains later in this section.For the moment, however, let’s move on to three stories of efficiencies that have had major consequencesfor Berkshire subsidiaries. Similar transformations have been commonplace throughout American business.
‹In 1947, shortly after the end of World War II, the American workforce totaled 44 million. About1.35 million workers were employed in the railroad industry. The revenue ton-miles of freight moved byClass I railroads that year totaled 655 billion.By 2014, Class I railroads carried 1.85 trillion ton-miles, an increase of 182%, while employing only187,000 workers, a reduction of 86% since 1947. (Some of this change involved passenger-relatedemployees, but most of the workforce reduction came on the freight side.) As a result of this staggeringimprovement in productivity, the inflation-adjusted price for moving a ton-mile of freight has fallen by55% since 1947, a drop saving shippers about $90 billion annuallyin current dollars. Another startling statistic: If it took as many people now to move freight as it did in 1947, we would needwell over three million railroad workers to handle present volumes. (Of course, that level of employmentwould raise freight charges by a lot; consequently, nothing close to today’s volume would actually move.)
21Our own BNSF was formed in 1995 by a merger between Burlington Northern and Santa Fe. In 1996, themerged company’s first full year of operation, 411 million ton-miles of freight were transported by 45,000employees. Last year the comparable figures were 702 million ton-miles (plus 71%) and 47,000 employees(plus only 4%). That dramatic gain in productivity benefits both owners and shippers. Safety at BNSF hasimproved as well: Reportable injuries were 2.04 per 200,000 man-hours in 1996 and have since fallen morethan 50% to 0.95.
‹A bit more than a century ago, the auto was invented, and around it formed an industry that insures carsand their drivers. Initially, this business was written through traditional insurance agencies – the kinddealing in fire insurance. This agency-centric approach included high commissions and other underwritingexpenses that consumed about 40¢ of the premium dollar. Strong local agencies were then in the driver’sseat because they represented multiple insurers and could play one company off against another whencommissions were being negotiated. Cartel-like pricing prevailed, and all involved were doing fine –except for the consumer.And then some American ingenuity came into play: G. J. Mecherle, a farmer from Merna, Illinois, came upwith the idea of a captive sales force that would sell the insurance products of only a single company. Hisbaby was christened State Farm Mutual. The company cut commissions and expenses – moves thatpermitted lower prices – and soon became a powerhouse. For many decades, State Farm has been therunaway volume leader in both auto and homeowner’s insurance. Allstate, which also operated with adirect distribution model, was long the runner-up. Both State Farm and Allstate have had underwritingexpenses of about 25%.In the early 1930s, another contender, United Services Auto Association (“USAA”), a mutual-likecompany, was writing auto insurance for military officers on a direct-to-the-customer basis. This marketinginnovation rose from a need that military personnel had to buy insurance that would stay with them as theymoved from base to base. That was business of little interest to local insurance agencies, which wanted thesteady renewals that came from permanent residents.The direct distribution method of USAA, as it happened, incurred lower costs than those enjoyed by StateFarm and Allstate and therefore delivered an even greater bargain to customers. That made Leo and LillianGoodwin, employees of USAA, dream of broadening the target market for its direct distribution modelbeyond military officers. In 1936, starting with $100,000 of capital, they incorporated GovernmentEmployees Insurance Co. (later compressing this mouthful to GEICO).Their fledgling did $238,000 of auto insurance business in 1937, its first full year. Last year GEICO did$22.6billion, more than double the volume of USAA. (Though the early bird gets the worm, the secondmouse gets the cheese.) GEICO’s underwriting expenses in 2015 were 14.7% of premiums, with USAAbeing the only large company to achieve a lower percentage. (GEICO is fully as efficient as USAA butspends considerably more on advertising aimed at promoting growth.)With the price advantage GEICO’s low costs allow, it’s not surprising that several years ago the companyseized the number two spot in auto insurance from Allstate. GEICO is also gaining ground on State Farm,though it is still far ahead of us in volume. On August 30, 2030 – my 100
thbirthday – I plan to announce that GEICO has taken over the top spot. Mark your calendar.GEICO employs about 34,000 people to serve its 14 million policyholders. I can only guess at theworkforce it would require to serve a similar number of policyholders under the agency system. I believe,however, that the number would be at least 60,000, a combination of what the insurer would need in directemployment and the personnel required at supporting agencies.
22‹In its electric utility business, our Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) operates within a changingeconomic model. Historically, the survival of a local electric company did not depend on its efficiency. Infact, a “sloppy” operation could do just fine financially.That’s because utilities were usually the sole supplier of a needed product and were allowed to price at alevel that gave them a prescribed return upon the capital they employed. The joke in the industry was that autility was the only business that would automatically earn more money by redecorating the boss’s office.And some CEOs ran things accordingly.That’s all changing. Today, society has decided that federally-subsidized wind and solar generation is inour country’s long-term interest. Federal tax credits are used to implement this policy, support that makesrenewables price-competitive in certain geographies. Those tax credits, or other government-mandated helpfor renewables, may eventually erode the economics of the incumbent utility, particularly if it is a high-costoperator. BHE’s long-established emphasis on efficiency – even when the company didn’t need it to attainauthorized earnings – leaves us particularly competitive in today’s market (and, more important, intomorrow’s as well).BHE acquired its Iowa utility in 1999. In the year before, that utility employed 3,700 people and produced19 million megawatt-hours of electricity. Now we employ 3,500 people and produce 29 million megawatt-hours. That major increase in efficiency allowed us to operate without a rate increase for 16 years, a periodduring which industry rates increased 44%.The safety record of our Iowa utility is also outstanding. It had .79 injuries per 100 employees in 2015compared to the rate of 7.0 experienced by the previous owner in the year before we bought the operation.In 2006 BHE purchased PacifiCorp, which operated primarily in Oregon and Utah. The year before ourpurchase PacifiCorp employed 6,750 people and produced 52.6 million megawatt-hours. Last year thenumbers were 5,700 employees and 56.3 million megawatt-hours. Here, too, safety improved dramatically,with the accident-rate-per-100-employees falling from 3.4 in 2005 to .85 in 2015. In safety, BHE nowranks in the industry’s top decile.Those outstanding performances explain why BHE is welcomed by regulators when it proposes to buy autility in their jurisdiction. The regulators know the company will run an efficient, safe and reliableoperation and also arrive with unlimited capital to fund whatever projects make sense. (BHE has never paida dividend to Berkshire since we assumed ownership. No investor-owned utility in America comes close tomatching BHE’s enthusiasm for reinvestment.)************The productivity gains that I’ve just spelled out – and countless others that have been achieved in America– have delivered awesome benefits to society. That’s the reason our citizens, as a whole, have enjoyed – and willcontinue to enjoy – major gains in the goods and services they receive.To this thought there are offsets. First, the productivity gains achieved in recent years have largelybenefitted the wealthy. Second, productivity gains frequently cause upheaval: Both capital and labor can pay aterrible price when innovation or new efficiencies upend their worlds.We need shed no tears for the capitalists (whether they be private owners or an army of publicshareholders). It’s their job to take care of themselves. When large rewards can flow to investors from gooddecisions, these parties should not be spared the losses produced by wrongchoices. Moreover, investors who diversify widely and simply sit tight with their holdings are certain to prosper: In America, gains from winninginvestments have alwaysfarmore than offset the losses from clunkers. (During the 20
thCentury, the Dow Jones Industrial Average – an index fund of sorts – soared from 66 to 11,497, with its component companies all the whilepaying ever-increasing dividends.)23A long-employed worker faces a different equation. When innovation and the market system interact toproduce efficiencies, many workers may be rendered unnecessary, their talents obsolete. Some can find decentemployment elsewhere; for others, that is not an option.When low-cost competition drove shoe production to Asia, our once-prosperous Dexter operation folded,putting 1,600 employees in a small Maine town out of work. Many were past the point in life at which they couldlearn another trade. We lost our entire investment, which we could afford, but many workers lost a livelihood theycould not replace. The same scenario unfolded in slow-motion at our original New England textile operation, whichstruggled for 20 years before expiring. Many older workers at our New Bedford plant, as a poignant example, spokePortuguese and knew little, if any, English. They had no Plan B.The answer in such disruptions is not the restraining or outlawing of actions that increase productivity.Americans would not be living nearly as well as we do if we had mandated that 11 million people should forever beemployed in farming.The solution, rather, is a variety of safety nets aimed at providing a decent life for those who are willing towork but find their specific talents judged of small value because of market forces. (I personally favor a reformedand expanded Earned Income Tax Credit that would try to make sure America works for those willing to work.) Theprice of achieving ever-increasing prosperity for the great majority of Americans should not be penury for theunfortunate.Important RisksWe, like all public companies, are required by the SEC to annually catalog “risk factors” in our 10-K. Ican’t remember, however, an instance when reading a 10-K’s “risk” section has helped me in evaluating a business.That’s not because the identified risks aren’t real. The truly important risks, however, are usually well known.Beyond that, a 10-K’s catalog of risks is seldom of aid in assessing: (1) the probability of the threatening eventactually occurring; (2) the range of costs if it does occur; and (3) the timing of the possible loss. A threat that willonly surface 50 years from now may be a problem for society, but it is not a financialproblem for today’s investor. Berkshire operates in more industries than any company I know of. Each of our pursuits has its own arrayof possible problems and opportunities. Those are easy to list but hard to evaluate: Charlie, I and our various CEOsoften differ in a very major way in our calculation of the likelihood, the timing and the cost (or benefit) that mayresult from these possibilities.Let me mention just a few examples. To begin with an obvious threat, BNSF, along with other railroads, iscertainto lose significant coal volume over the next decade. At some point in the future – though not, in my view,for a long time – GEICO’s premium volumemayshrink because of driverless cars. This development could hurt our auto dealerships as well. Circulation of our print newspapers will continue to fall, a certainty we allowed for whenpurchasing them. To date, renewables have helped our utility operation but that could change, particularly if storagecapabilities for electricity materially improve. Online retailing threatens the business model of our retailers andcertain of our consumer brands. These potentialities are just a few of the negative possibilities facing us – but eventhe most casual follower of business news has long been aware of them.None of these problems, however, is crucial to Berkshire’s long-term well-being. When we took over thecompany in 1965, its risks could have been encapsulated in a single sentence: “The northern textile business inwhich all of our capital resides is destined for recurring losses and will eventually disappear.” That development,however, was no death knell. We simply adapted. And we will continue to do so.
24Every day Berkshire managers are thinking about how they can better compete in an always-changingworld. Just as vigorously, Charlie and I focus on where a steady stream of funds should be deployed. In that respect,we possess a major advantage over one-industry companies, whose options are far more limited. I firmly believethat Berkshire has the money, talent and culture to plow through the sort of adversities I’ve itemized above – andmany more – and to emerge with ever-greater earning power.There is, however, one clear, present and enduring danger to Berkshire against which Charlie and I arepowerless. That threat to Berkshire is also the major threat our citizenry faces: a “successful” (as defined by theaggressor) cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack on the United States. That is a risk Berkshire shares with all of American business.The probability of such mass destruction in any given year is likely very small. It’s been more than 70years since I delivered a Washington Post newspaper headlining the fact that the United States had dropped the firstatomic bomb. Subsequently, we’ve had a few close calls but avoided catastrophic destruction. We can thank ourgovernment – and luck! – for this result.Nevertheless, what’s a small probability in a short period approaches certainty in the longer run. (If there isonly one chance in thirty of an event occurring in a given year, the likelihood of it occurring at least once in acentury is 96.6%.) The added bad news is that there will forever be people and organizations and perhaps evennations that would like to inflict maximum damage on our country. Their means of doing so have increasedexponentially during my lifetime. “Innovation” has its dark side.There is no way for American corporations or their investors to shed this risk. If an event occurs in the U.S.that leads to mass devastation, the value of all equity investments will almost certainly be decimated.No one knows what “the day after” will look like. I think, however, that Einstein’s 1949 appraisal remainsapt: “I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks andstones.”************I am writing this section because we have a proxy proposal regarding climate change to consider at thisyear’s annual meeting. The sponsor would like us to provide a report on the dangers that this change might presentto our insurance operation and explain how we are responding to these threats.It seems highly likely to me that climate change poses a major problem for the planet. I say “highly likely”rather than “certain” because I have no scientific aptitude and remember well the dire predictions of most “experts”about Y2K. It would be foolish, however, for me or anyone to demand 100% proof of huge forthcoming damage tothe world if that outcome seemed at all possible and if prompt action had even a small chance of thwarting thedanger.This issue bears a similarity to Pascal’s Wager on the Existence of God. Pascal, it may be recalled, arguedthat if there were only a tiny probability that God truly existed, it made sense to behave as if He did because therewards could be infinite whereas the lack of belief risked eternal misery. Likewise, if there is only a 1% chance theplanet is heading toward a truly major disaster and delay means passing a point of no return, inaction now isfoolhardy. Call this Noah’s Law: If an ark may be essential for survival, begin building it today, no matter how cloudless the skies appear.It’s understandable that the sponsor of the proxy proposal believes Berkshire is especially threatened byclimate change because we are a huge insurer, covering all sorts of risks. The sponsor may worry that propertylosses will skyrocket because of weather changes. And such worries might, in fact, be warranted if we wrote ten- ortwenty-year policies at fixed prices. But insurance policies are customarily written for one year and repricedannually to reflect changing exposures. Increased possibilities of loss translate promptly into increased premiums.25Think back to 1951 when I first became enthused about GEICO. The company’s average loss-per-policywas then about $30 annually. Imagine your reaction if I had predicted then that in 2015 the loss costs would increaseto about $1,000 per policy. Wouldn’t such skyrocketing losses prove disastrous, you might ask? Well, no.Over the years, inflation has caused a huge increase in the cost of repairing both the cars and the humansinvolved in accidents. But these increased costs have been promptly matched by increased premiums. So,paradoxically, the upward march in loss costs has made insurance companies far more valuable. If costs had remained unchanged, Berkshire would now own an auto insurer doing $600 million of business annually rather thanone doing $23 billion.Up to now, climate change hasnotproduced more frequent nor more costly hurricanes nor other weather-related events covered by insurance. As a consequence, U.S. super-cat rates have fallensteadily in recent years, which is why we have backed away from that business. If super-cats become costlier and more frequent, the likely –though far from certain – effect on Berkshire’s insurance business would be to make it larger and more profitable.As a citizen, you may understandably find climate change keeping you up nights. As a homeowner in alow-lying area, you may wish to consider moving. But when you are thinking only as a shareholder of a majorinsurer, climate change should not be on your list of worries.The Annual MeetingCharlie and I have finally decided to enter the 21
stCentury. Our annual meeting this year will be webcast worldwide in its entirety. To view the meeting, simply go to https://finance.yahoo.com/brklivestream at 9 a.m.Central Daylight Time on Saturday, April 30
th. The Yahoo! webcast will begin with a half hour of interviews withmanagers, directors and shareholders. Then, at 9:30, Charlie and I will commence answering questions.This new arrangement will serve two purposes. First, it may level off or modestly decrease attendance atthe meeting. Last year’s record of more than 40,000 attendees strained our capacity. In addition to quickly filling theCenturyLink Center’s main arena, we packed its overflow rooms and then spilled into two large meeting rooms atthe adjoining Omaha Hilton. All major hotels were sold out notwithstanding Airbnb’s stepped-up presence. Airbnbwas especially helpful for those visitors on limited budgets.Our second reason for initiating a webcast is more important. Charlie is 92, and I am 85. If we werepartners with you in a small business, and were charged with running the place, you would want to look inoccasionally to make sure we hadn’t drifted off into la-la land. Shareholders, in contrast, should not need to come toOmaha to monitor how we look and sound. (In making your evaluation, be kind: Allow for the fact that we didn’tlook that impressive when we were at our best.)Viewers can also observe our life-prolonging diet. During the meeting, Charlie and I will each consumeenough Coke, See’s fudge and See’s peanut brittle to satisfy the weekly caloric needs of an NFL lineman. Long agowe discovered a fundamental truth: There’s nothing like eating carrots and broccoli when you’re reallyhungry – and want to stay that way.Shareholders planning to attend the meeting should come at 7 a.m. when the doors open at CenturyLinkCenter andstart shopping. Carrie Sova will again be in charge of the festivities. She had her second child late lastmonth, but that did not slow her down. Carrie is unflappable, ingenious and expert at bringing out the best in thosewho work with her. She is aided by hundreds of Berkshire employees from around the country and by our entirehome office crew as well, all of them pitching in to make the weekend fun and informative for our owners.
26Last year we increased the number of hours available for shopping at the CenturyLink. Sales skyrocketed –so, naturally, we will stay with the new schedule. On Friday, April 29
thyou can shop between noon and 5 p.m., and on Saturday exhibits and stores will be open from 7 a.m. until 4:30 p.m.On Saturday morning, we will have our fifth International Newspaper Tossing Challenge. Our target willagain be a Clayton Home porch, located precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. When I was a teenager – in myone brief flirtation with honest labor – I delivered about 500,000 papers. So I think I’m pretty good at this game.Challenge me! Humiliate me! Knock me down a peg! The papers will run 36 to 42 pages, and you must fold themyourself (no rubber bands allowed).The competition begins at 7:15, when contestants will make preliminary tosses. The eight throws judgedmost accurate – four made by contestants 12 or under, and four made by the older set – will compete against me at7:45. The young challengers will each receive a prize. But the older ones will have to beat me to take anythinghome.And be sure to check out the Clayton home itself. It can be purchased for $78,900, fully installed on landyou provide. In past years, we’ve made many sales on the meeting day. Kevin Clayton will be on hand with hisorder book.At 8:30 a.m., a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answerperiod, which (including a break for lunch at CenturyLink’s stands) will last until 3:30 p.m. After a short recess,Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45 p.m. This business session typically lasts only a half hour orso and can safely be skipped by those craving a little last-minute shopping.Your venue for shopping will be the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting and in whichproducts from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries will be for sale. Say hello to the many Berkshire managers who willbe captaining their exhibits. And be sure to view the terrific BNSF railroad layout that salutes all of our subsidiaries.Your children (and you!) will be enchanted with it.We will have a new and very special exhibit in the hall this year: a full-size model of the world’s largestaircraft engine, for which Precision Castparts makes many key components. The real engines weigh about 20,000pounds and are ten feet in diameter and 22 feet in length. The bisected model at the meeting will give you a goodlook at many PCC components that help power your flights.Brooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at the meeting.After you purchase a pair, wear them on Sunday at our fourth annual “Berkshire 5K,” an 8 a.m. race starting at theCenturyLink. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor’s Guide that will be sent to you with yourmeeting credentials. Entrants in the race will find themselves running alongside many of Berkshire’s managers,directors and associates. (Charlie and I, however, will sleep in; the fudge and peanut brittle take their toll.)Participation in the 5K grows every year. Help us set another record.A GEICO booth in the shopping area will be staffed by a number of the company’s top counselors fromaround the country. Stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount(usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplementalpoint: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another discount, such as that available to certain groups.)Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out our price. We can save many of you real money. Spendthe savings on our other products.
27Be sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry about 35 books and DVDs, among them a couple of new titles.Andy Kilpatrick will introduce (and be glad to sign) the latest edition of his all-encompassing coverage ofBerkshire. It’s 1,304 pages and weighs 9.8 pounds. (My blurb for the book: “Ridiculously skimpy.”) Check outPeter Bevelin’s new book as well. Peter has long been a keen observer of Berkshire.We will also have a new, 20-page-longer edition of Berkshire’s 50-year commemorative book that at lastyear’s meeting sold 12,000 copies. Since then, Carrie and I have uncovered additional material that we findfascinating, such as some very personal letters sent by Grover Cleveland to Edward Butler, his friend and the then-publisher ofThe Buffalo News. Nothing from the original edition has been changed or eliminated, and the priceremains $20. Charlie and I will jointly sign 100 copies that will be randomly placed among the 5,000 available forsale at the meeting.My friend, Phil Beuth, has writtenLimping on Water, an autobiography that chronicles his life at Capital Cities Communications and tells you a lot about its leaders, Tom Murphy and Dan Burke. These two were the bestmanagerial duo – both inwhatthey accomplished andhowthey did it – that Charlie and I ever witnessed. Much of what you become in life depends on whom you choose to admire and copy. Start with Tom Murphy, and you’llnever need a second exemplar.Finally, Jeremy Miller has writtenWarren Buffett’s Ground Rules, a book that will debut at the annual meeting. Mr. Miller has done a superb job of researching and dissecting the operation of Buffett Partnership Ltd.and of explaining how Berkshire’s culture has evolved from its BPL origin. If you are fascinated by investmenttheory and practice, you will enjoy this book.An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain thecredential you will need for admission to both the meeting and other events. Airlines have sometimes jacked upprices for the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City vs.Omaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2
1⁄2hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you significant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. The savings for a couple could run to$1,000 or more. Spend that money with us.At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72
ndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. Last year in the week encompassing the meeting, the storedid a record $44,239,493 of business. If you repeat that figure to a retailer, he is not going to believe you. (Anaverage week for NFM’s Omaha store – the highest-volume home furnishings store in the United States except forour new Dallas store – is about $9 million.)To obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, April 26
thand Monday, May 2
ndinclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even apply tothe products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, inthe spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. During“Berkshire Weekend” NFM will be open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. onSaturday and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday. From 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday, NFM is hosting a picnic to whichyou are all invited.At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from 6p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, April 29
th. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 1st, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will remain open until 6 p.m. During last year’s Friday-Sunday stretch, the store wrote a salesticket every 15 seconds that it was open.
28We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 25
ththrough Saturday, May 7th. During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder either by presenting your meeting credential or a brokerage statement showingyou own our stock.On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, Norman Beck, a remarkable magician from Dallas, willbewilder onlookers. On the upper level, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the world’s topbridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. I will join them and hope tohave Ajit and Charlie there also.My friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. I metAriel when she was nine and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Now, she’s a junior at Princeton,having already represented the United States in the 2012 Olympics. If you don’t mind embarrassing yourself, testyour skills against her, beginning at 1 p.m. Bill Gates and I will lead off and try to soften her up.Gorat’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 1
st, serving from 1 p.m. until 10 p.m. To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call 402-551-3733 on April 1
st(but not before). As for my other favorite restaurant, Piccolo’s, I’m sad to report it closed.We will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the meeting,asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, the preeminent business journalist of her time, who may be e-mailed atloomisbrk@gmail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, ofThe New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most interestingand important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you keep itconcise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than two questions inany e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if yourquestion is asked.)An accompanying set of questions will be asked by three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year theinsurance specialist will be Cliff Gallant of Nomura Securities. Questions that deal with our non-insuranceoperations will come from Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Ourhope is that the analysts and journalists will ask questions that add to our owners’ understanding and knowledge oftheir investment.Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be tough,for sure, and that’s the way we like it. Multi-part questions aren’t allowed; we want to give as many questioners aspossible a shot at us.All told we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and for18 from the audience. (Last year we had 64 in total.) The questioners from the audience will be chosen by means of11 drawings that will take place at 8:15 a.m. on the morning of the annual meeting. Each of the 11 microphonesinstalled in the arena and main overflow room will host, so to speak, a drawing.
29While I’m on the subject of our owners’ gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believeall shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and, if possible,should also have adequate time to digest and analyze it before any trading takes place. That’s why we try to issuefinancial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is always held on a Saturday. Wedo not follow the common practice of talking one-on-one with large institutional investors or analysts, treating theminstead as we do all other shareholders. There is no one more important to us than the shareholder of limited meanswho trusts us with a substantial portion of his savings.************For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-Starswho run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I also believe the mindset of ourmanagers to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most ofour managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business “home runs” means as much to them astheir paycheck.Equally important, however, are the 24 men and women who work with me at our corporate office. Thisgroup efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 30,400-page Federalincome tax return – that’s up 6,000 pages from the prior year! – oversees the filing of 3,530 state tax returns,responds to countless shareholder and media inquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country’s largestannual meeting, coordinates the Board’s activities, fact-checks this letter – and the list goes on and on.They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easyand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year, for example, they dealt withthe 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They alsohandle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and french fries(smothered in Heinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly do feel like tap dancing to workevery day. In fact, my job becomes more fun every year.In 2015, Berkshire’s revenues increased by $16 billion. Look carefully, however, at the two pictures on thefacing page. The top one is from last year’s report and shows the entire Berkshire home-office crew at ourChristmas lunch. Below that photo is this year’s Christmas photo portraying the same25 people identically positioned. In 2015, no one joined us, no one left. And the odds are good that you will see a photo of the same 25next year.Can you imagine another very large company – we employ 361,270 people worldwide – enjoying that kindof employment stability at headquarters? At Berkshire we have hired some wonderful people – and they have stayedwith us. Moreover, no one is hired unless he or she is truly needed. That’s why you’ve never read about“restructuring” charges at Berkshire.On April 30
th, come to Omaha – the cradle of capitalism – and meet my gang. They are the best.February 27, 2016 Warren E. BuffettChairman of the Board

Notes:Data are for calendar years with these exceptions: 1965 and 1966, year ended 9/30; 1967, 15 months ended 12/31. Starting in 1979,accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market rather than at the lower of cost or market, whichwas previously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire’s results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all otherrespects, the results are calculated using the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-taxwhereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would havelagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed anegative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.
2BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:Berkshire’s gain in net worth during 2016 was $27.5 billion, which increased the per-share book valueof both our Class A and Class B stock by 10.7%. Over the last 52 years (that is, since present management tookover), per-share book value has grown from $19 to $172,108, a rate of 19% compounded annually.*During the first half of those years, Berkshire’s net worth was roughly equal to the number that reallycounts: the intrinsic value of the business. The similarity of the two figures existed then because most of ourresources were deployed in marketable securities that were regularly revalued to their quoted prices (less the taxthat would be incurred if they were to be sold). In Wall Street parlance, our balance sheet was then in very largepart “marked to market.”By the early 1990s, however, our focus was changing to the outright ownership of businesses, a shiftthat materially diminished the relevance of balance sheet figures. That disconnect occurred because theaccounting rules (commonly referred to as “GAAP”) that apply to companies we control differ in important waysfrom those used to value marketable securities. Specifically, the accounting for businesseswe own requires that the carrying value of “losers” be written down when their failures become apparent. “Winners,” conversely, areneverrevalued upwards.We’ve experienced both outcomes: As is the case in marriage, business acquisitions often deliversurprisesafterthe “I do’s.” I’ve made some dumb purchases, paying far too much for the economic goodwill ofcompanies we acquired. That later led to goodwill write-offs and to consequent reductions in Berkshire’s bookvalue. We’ve also had some winners among the businesses we’ve purchased – a few of the winners very big –but have not written those up by a penny.We have no quarrel with the asymmetrical accounting that applies here. But, over time, it necessarilywidens the gap between Berkshire’s intrinsic value and its book value. Today, the large – and growing –unrecorded gains at our winners produce an intrinsic value for Berkshire’s shares that farexceeds their book value. The overage is truly huge in our property/casualty insurance business and significant also in many otheroperations.Over time, stock prices gravitate toward intrinsic value. That’s what has happened at Berkshire, a factexplaining why the company’s 52-year market-price gain – shown on the facing page – materially exceeds itsbook-value gain.* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500
thof those shown for A. 3What We Hope to AccomplishCharlie Munger, Berkshire’s Vice Chairman and my partner, and I expect Berkshire’s normalized earning power per share to increase every year. Actualearnings, of course, will sometimes decline because of periodic weakness in the U.S. economy. In addition, insurance mega-catastrophes or other industry-specificevents may occasionally reduce earnings at Berkshire, even when most American businesses are doing well.It’s our job, though, to over time deliver significant growth, bumpy or not. After all, as stewards of your capital, Berkshire directors have opted to retain all earnings. Indeed, in both 2015 and 2016 Berkshire rankedfirst among American businesses in the dollar volume of earnings retained, in each year reinvesting manybillions of dollars more than did the runner-up. Those reinvested dollars must earn their keep.Some years, the gains in underlying earning power we achieve will be minor; very occasionally, thecash register will ring loud. Charlie and I have no magic plan to add earnings except to dream big and to beprepared mentally and financially to act fast when opportunities present themselves. Every decade or so, darkclouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold. When downpours of that sort occur, it’simperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.I earlier described our gradual shift from a company obtaining most of its gains from investmentactivities to one that grows in value by owning businesses. Launching that transition, we took baby steps –making small acquisitions whose impact on Berkshire’s profits was dwarfed by our gains from marketablesecurities. Despite that cautious approach, I made one particularly egregious error, acquiring Dexter Shoe for$434 million in 1993. Dexter’s value promptly went to zero. The story gets worse: I used stock for the purchase,giving the sellers 25,203 shares of Berkshire that at yearend 2016 were worth more than $6 billion.That wreck was followed by three key happenings – two positive, one negative – that set us firmly onour present course. At the beginning of 1996, we acquired the half of GEICO we didn’t already own, a cashtransaction that changed our holding from a portfolio investment into a wholly-owned operating business.GEICO, with its almost unlimited potential, quickly became the centerpiece around which we built what I believeis now the world’s premier property/casualty business.Unfortunately, I followed the GEICO purchase by foolishly using Berkshire stock – a boatloadof stock – to buy General Reinsurance in late 1998. After some early problems, General Re has become a fineinsurance operation that we prize. It was, nevertheless, a terrible mistake on my part to issue 272,200 shares ofBerkshire in buying General Re, an act that increased our outstanding shares by a whopping 21.8%. My errorcaused Berkshire shareholders to give far more than they received (a practice that – despite the Biblicalendorsement – is far from blessed when you are buying businesses).Early in 2000, I atoned for that folly by buying 76% (since grown to 90%) of MidAmerican Energy, abrilliantly-managed utility business that has delivered us many large opportunities to make profitable andsocially-useful investments. The MidAmerican cashpurchase – I was learning – firmly launched us on our present course of (1) continuing to build our insurance operation; (2) energetically acquiring large and diversifiednon-insurance businesses and (3) largely making our deals from internally-generated cash. (Today, I would ratherprep for a colonoscopy than issue Berkshire shares.)Our portfolio of bonds and stocks, de-emphasized though it is, has continued in the post-1998 period togrow and to deliver us hefty capital gains, interest, and dividends. Those portfolio earnings have provided usmajor help in financing the purchase of businesses. Though unconventional, Berkshire’s two-pronged approachto capital allocation gives us a real edge.
4Here’s our financial record since 1999, when the redirection of our business began in earnest. Duringthe 18-year period covered, Berkshire’s outstanding shares grew by only 8.3%, with most of the increaseoccurring when we purchased BNSF. That, I’m happy to say, was one issuance of stock that made good sense.After-Tax Earnings(in billions of dollars)Year

(2) In very large part, this tabulation includes only realizedcapital gains or losses. Unrealized gains and losses are also included, however, when GAAP requires that treatment.Our expectation is that investment gains will continue to be substantial – though totally random as totiming – and that these will supply significant funds for business purchases. Concurrently, Berkshire’s superbcorps of operating CEOs will focus on increasing earnings at the individual businesses they manage, sometimeshelping them to grow by making bolt-on acquisitions. By our avoiding the issuance of Berkshire stock, anyimprovement in earnings will translate into equivalent per-share gains.************Our efforts to materially increase the normalized earnings of Berkshire will be aided – as they have beenthroughout our managerial tenure – by America’s economic dynamism. One word sums up our country’sachievements: miraculous. From a standing start 240 years ago – a span of time less than triple my days onearth – Americans have combined human ingenuity, a market system, a tide of talented and ambitiousimmigrants, and the rule of law to deliver abundance beyond any dreams of our forefathers.You need not be an economist to understand how well our system has worked. Just look around you.See the 75 million owner-occupied homes, the bountiful farmland, the 260 million vehicles, the hyper-productivefactories, the great medical centers, the talent-filled universities, you name it – they all represent a net gain forAmericans from the barren lands, primitive structures and meager output of 1776. Starting from scratch, Americahas amassed wealth totaling $90 trillion.
5It’s true, of course, that American owners of homes, autos and other assets have often borrowed heavilyto finance their purchases. If an owner defaults, however, his or her asset does not disappear or lose itsusefulness. Rather, ownership customarily passes to an American lending institution that then disposes of it to anAmerican buyer. Ournation’swealth remains intact. As Gertrude Stein put it, “Money is always there, but thepockets change.”Above all, it’s our market system – an economic traffic cop ably directing capital, brains and labor –that has created America’s abundance. This system has also been the primary factor in allocating rewards.Governmental redirection, through federal, state and local taxation, has in addition determined the distribution ofa significant portion of the bounty.America has, for example, decided that those citizens in their productive years should help both the oldand the young. Such forms of aid – sometimes enshrined as “entitlements” – are generally thought of as applyingto the aged. But don’t forget that four million American babies are born each year with an entitlement to a publiceducation. That societal commitment, largely financed at the local level, costs about $150,000 per baby. Theannual cost totals more than $600 billion, which is about 3
1⁄2% of GDP. However our wealth may be divided, the mind-boggling amounts you see around you belong almostexclusively to Americans. Foreigners, of course, own or have claims on a modest portion of our wealth. Thoseholdings, however, are of little importance to our national balance sheet: Ourcitizens own assets abroad that are roughly comparable in value.Early Americans, we should emphasize, were neither smarter nor more hard working than those peoplewho toiled century after century before them. But those venturesome pioneers crafted a system that unleashedhuman potential, and their successors built upon it.This economic creation will deliver increasing wealth to our progeny far into the future. Yes, thebuild-up of wealth will be interrupted for short periods from time to time. It will not ,however, be stopped. I’ll repeat what I’ve both said in the past and expect to say in future years: Babies born in America today are theluckiest crop in history.************America’s economic achievements have led to staggering profits for stockholders. During the 20
th
century the Dow-Jones Industrials advanced from 66 to 11,497, a 17,320% capital gain that was materiallyboosted by steadily increasing dividends. The trend continues: By yearend 2016, the index had advanced afurther 72%, to 19,763.American business – and consequently a basket of stocks – is virtually certain to be worth far more inthe years ahead. Innovation, productivity gains, entrepreneurial spirit and an abundance of capital will see to that.Ever-present naysayers may prosper by marketing their gloomy forecasts. But heaven help them if they act on thenonsense they peddle.Many companies, of course, will fall behind, and some will fail. Winnowing of that sort is a product ofmarket dynamism. Moreover, the years ahead will occasionally deliver major market declines – even panics –that will affect virtually all stocks. No one can tell you when these traumas will occur – not me, not Charlie, noteconomists, not the media. Meg McConnell of the New York Fed aptly described the reality of panics: “Wespend a lot of time looking for systemic risk; in truth, however, it tends to find us.”During such scary periods, you should never forget two things: First, widespread fear is your friendas an investor, because it serves up bargain purchases. Second, personalfear is your enemy. It will also be unwarranted. Investors who avoid high and unnecessary costs and simply sit for an extended period with acollection of large, conservatively-financed American businesses will almost certainly do well.As for Berkshire, our size precludes abrilliantresult: Prospective returns fall as assets increase. Nonetheless, Berkshire’s collection of good businesses, along with the company’s impregnable financial strengthand owner-oriented culture, should deliver decent results. We won’t be satisfied with less. 6Share RepurchasesIn the investment world, discussions about share repurchases often become heated. But I’d suggest thatparticipants in this debate take a deep breath: Assessing the desirability of repurchases isn’t that complicated.From the standpoint of exiting shareholders, repurchases are always a plus. Though the day-to-day impact ofthese purchases is usually minuscule, it’s always better for a seller to have an additional buyer in the market.For continuing shareholders, however, repurchases only make sense if the shares are bought at a pricebelow intrinsic value. When that rule is followed, the remaining shares experience an immediate gain in intrinsicvalue. Consider a simple analogy: If there are three equal partners in a business worth $3,000 and one is boughtout by the partnership for $900, each of the remaining partners realizes an immediate gain of $50. If the exitingpartner is paid $1,100, however, the continuing partners each suffer a loss of $50. The same math applies withcorporations and their shareholders. Ergo, the question of whether a repurchase action is value-enhancing orvalue-destroying for continuing shareholders is entirely purchase-price dependent.It is puzzling, therefore, that corporate repurchase announcements almost never refer to a price abovewhich repurchases will be eschewed. That certainly wouldn’t be the case if a management was buying an outsidebusiness. There, price would always factor into a buy-or-pass decision.When CEOs or boards are buying a small part of their own company, though, they all too often seemoblivious to price. Would they behave similarly if they were managing a private company with just a few ownersand were evaluating the wisdom of buying out one of them? Of course not.It is important to remember that there are two occasions in which repurchases should not take place,even if the company’s shares are underpriced. One is when a business both needs all its available money toprotect or expand its own operations and is also uncomfortable adding further debt. Here, the internal need forfunds should take priority. This exception assumes, of course, that the business has a decent future awaiting itafter the needed expenditures are made.The second exception, less common, materializes when a business acquisition (or some other investmentopportunity) offers far greater value than do the undervalued shares of the potential repurchaser. Long ago,Berkshire itself often had to choose between these alternatives. At our present size, the issue is far less likely toarise.My suggestion: Before even discussing repurchases, a CEO and his or her Board should stand, joinhands and in unison declare, “What is smart at one price is stupid at another.”************To recap Berkshire’s own repurchase policy: I am authorized to buy large amounts of Berkshire shares at120% or less of book value because our Board has concluded that purchases at that level clearly bring an instant andmaterial benefit to continuing shareholders. By our estimate, a 120%-of-book price is a significant discount toBerkshire’s intrinsic value, a spread that is appropriate because calculations of intrinsic value can’t be precise.The authorization given me does not mean that we will “prop” our stock’s price at the 120% ratio. Ifthat level is reached, we will instead attempt to blend a desire to make meaningful purchases at a value-creatingprice with a related goal of not over-influencing the market.To date, repurchasing our shares has proved hard to do. That may well be because we have been clear indescribing our repurchase policy and thereby have signaled our view that Berkshire’s intrinsic value issignificantly higher than 120% of book value. If so, that’s fine. Charlie and I prefer to see Berkshire shares sell ina fairly narrow range around intrinsic value, neither wishing them to sell at an unwarranted high price – it’s nofun having owners who are disappointed with their purchases – nor one too low. Furthermore, our buying out“partners” at a discount is not a particularly gratifying way of making money. Still, market circumstances couldcreate a situation in which repurchases would benefit both continuing and exiting shareholders. If so, we will beready to act. 7One final observation for this section: As the subject of repurchases has come to a boil, some peoplehave come close to calling them un-American – characterizing them as corporate misdeeds that divert fundsneeded for productive endeavors. That simply isn’t the case: Both American corporations and private investorsare today awash in funds looking to be sensibly deployed. I’m not aware of anyenticing project that in recent years has died for lack of capital. (Call us if you have a candidate.)InsuranceLet’s now look at Berkshire’s various businesses, starting with our most important sector, insurance.The property/casualty (“P/C”) branch of that industry has been the engine that has propelled our growth since1967, the year we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire & Marine, for $8.6 million.Today, National Indemnity is the largest property/casualty company in the world as measured by net worth.One reason we were attracted to the P/C business was its financial characteristics: P/C insurers receivepremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos,payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding largesums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float fortheir own benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holdsusually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does ourfloat. Andhowit has grown, as the following table shows:Year
Float (in millions)
1970$ 391980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322016 91,577We recently wrote a huge policy that increased float to more than $100 billion. Beyond that one-timeboost, float at GEICO and several of our specialized operations is almost certain to grow at a good clip. NationalIndemnity’s reinsurance division, however, is party to a number of large run-off contracts whose float is certainto drift downward.We may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline will be verygradual – at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can neverbe subject to immediate or near-term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. This structure is bydesign and is a key component in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. It will neverbe compromised.If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registersan underwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, weenjoy the use of free money – and, better yet, get paidfor holding it.Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, sovigorous indeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that theinsurance industry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earningsubnormal returns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses.
8This outcome is made more certain by the dramatically lower interest rates that now exist throughout theworld. The investment portfolios of almost all P/C companies – though notthose of Berkshire – are heavily concentrated in bonds. As these high-yielding legacy investments mature and are replaced by bonds yielding apittance, earnings from float will steadily fall. For that reason, and others as well, it’s a good bet that industryresults over the next ten years will fall short of those recorded in the past decade, particularly in the case ofcompanies that specialize in reinsurance.Nevertheless, I very much like our own prospects. Berkshire’s unrivaled financial strength allows us farmore flexibility in investing than that generally available to P/C companies. The many alternatives available to usare always an advantage; occasionally, they offer us major opportunities. When others are constrained, ourchoices expand.Moreover, our P/C companies have an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at anunderwriting profit for 14 consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $28 billion. Thatrecord is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of allof our insurance managers, who know that while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give thatmessage lip service. At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.So how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire’s bookvalue is calculated, thefullamount of our float is deducted as aliability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But tothink of float as a typical liability is a major mistake. It should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, wepay old claims and related expenses – a huge $27 billion to more than six million claimants in 2016 – and thatreduces float. Just as surely, we each day write new business that will soon generate its own claims, adding tofloat.If our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of thisliability isdramaticallyless than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises –because new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute – is worlds different from owing $1 that will go outthe door tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities, however, are treated as equals under GAAP.A partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion “goodwill” asset that we incurred in buyingour insurance companies and that is included in our book-value figure. In very large part, this goodwill representsthe price we paid for the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill,however, hasnobearing on its true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolongedunderwriting losses,anygoodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its originalcost.Fortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of ourinsurance goodwill – what we would happily pay for float of similar qualitywere we to purchase an insurance operation possessing it – to befarin excess of its historic carrying value. Indeed, almost the entire $15.5 billionwe carry for goodwill in our insurance business was already on our books in 2000 when float was $28 billion.Yet we have subsequently increased our float by $64 billion, a gain that in no way is reflected in our book value.This unrecorded asset is one reason – a huge reason – why we believe Berkshire’s intrinsic business value farexceeds its book value.************Berkshire’s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers runningdisciplined operations that in most cases possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about themajor units.First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insuresrisks that no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed,decisiveness and, most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposesBerkshire to risks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources.9Indeed, Berkshire isfarmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if theinsurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe – a loss about tripleanything it has ever experienced – Berkshire as a whole would likely record a large profit for the year. Our manystreams of non-insurance earnings would see to that. Additionally, we would remain awash in cash and be eagerto write business in an insurance market that might well be in disarray. Meanwhile, other major insurers andreinsurers would be swimming in red ink, if not facing insolvency.When Ajit entered Berkshire’s office on a Saturday in 1986, he did not have a day’s experience in theinsurance business. Nevertheless, Mike Goldberg, then our manager of insurance, handed him the keys to oursmall and struggling reinsurance business. With that move, Mike achieved sainthood: Since then, Ajit has createdtens of billions of value for Berkshire shareholders. If there were ever to be another Ajit and you could swap mefor him,don’t hesitate. Make the trade!************We have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed until recently by Tad Montross. After39 years at General Re, Tad retired in 2016. Tad was a class act in every way and we owe him a ton of thanks.Kara Raiguel, who has worked with Ajit for 16 years, is now CEO of General Re.At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all exposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposureactually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profitafter both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if theappropriate premium can’t be obtained.Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can’t turn their back onbusiness that is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, “The other guy is doing it, so we mustas well,” spells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance. Tad never listened to thatnonsensical excuse for sloppy underwriting, and neither will Kara.************Finally, there is GEICO, the company that set my heart afire 66 years ago (and for which the flame stillburns). GEICO is managed by Tony Nicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 55 years of service in2016.Tony became CEO of GEICO in 1993, and since then the company has been flying. There is nobetter manager than Tony, who brings his combination of brilliance, dedication andsoundness to the job. (The latter quality is essential to sustained success. As Charlie says, it’s great to have a manager with a 160 IQ – unless hethinks it’s 180.) Like Ajit, Tony has created tens of billions of value for Berkshire.On my initial visit to GEICO in 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage the companyenjoyed over the giants of the industry. It was clear to me that GEICO would succeed because it deservedto succeed. The company’s annual sales were then $8 million; In 2016, GEICO did that much business every threehours of the year.Auto insurance is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them – and only a low-costoperation can deliver those. In fact, at least 40% of the people reading this letter can save money by insuring withGEICO. So stop reading – right now! – and go to geico.com or call 800-847-7536.GEICO’s low costs create a moat – anenduringone – that competitors are unable to cross. As a result, the company gobbles up market share year after year, ending 2016 with about 12% of industry volume. That’s upfrom 2.5% in 1995, the year Berkshire acquired control of GEICO. Employment, meanwhile, grew from 8,575 to36,085.10GEICO’s growth accelerated dramatically during the second half of 2016. Loss costs throughout theauto-insurance industry had been increasing at an unexpected pace and some competitors lost their enthusiasmfor taking on new customers. GEICO’s reaction to the profit squeeze, however, was to accelerateits new-business efforts. We like to make hay while the sun sets, knowing that it will surely rise again. GEICO continues on a roll as I send you this letter. When insurance prices increase, people shop more.And when they shop, GEICO wins.Have you called yet? (800-847-7536 or go to geico.com)************In addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a collection of smaller companies thatprimarily write commercial coverages. In aggregate, these companies are a large, growing and valuable operationthat consistently delivers an underwriting profit, usually one much superior to that reported by their competitors.Over the past 14 years, this group has earned $4.7 billion from underwriting – about 13% of its premiumvolume – while increasing its float from $943 million to $11.6 billion.Less than three years ago, we formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BHSI”), which isincluded in this grouping. Our first decision was to put Peter Eastwood in charge, a move that proved to be ahome run: We expected significant losses in the early years while Peter built the personnel and infrastructureneeded for a world-wide operation. Instead, he and his crew delivered significant underwriting profits throughoutthe start-up period. BHSI’s volume increased 40% in 2016, reaching $1.3 billion. It’s clear to me that thecompany is destined to become one of the world’s leading P/C insurers.Here’s a recap ofpre-tax underwriting earnings and float by division:Underwriting Profit

Berkshire’s great managers, premier financial strength and a range of business models protected by widemoats amount to something unique in the insurance world. This assemblage of strengths is a huge asset forBerkshire shareholders that time will only make more valuable.Regulated, Capital-Intensive BusinessesOur BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”), our 90%-owned utility business, shareimportant characteristics that distinguish them from Berkshire’s other activities. Consequently, we assign themtheir own section in this letter and split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet andincome statement. These two very major companies accounted for 33% of Berkshire’s after-tax operatingearnings last year.
11A key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets,with these partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact not needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions wouldfar exceed its interest requirements. Last year, for example, in a disappointing year for railroads, BNSF’s interestcoverage was more than 6:1. (Our definition of coverage is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes tointerest,notEBITDA/interest, a commonly-used measure we view as seriously flawed.)At BHE, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company’s ability to service its debt under allcircumstances. The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from thesecompanies offering an essential service for which demand is remarkably steady. The second is enjoyed by fewother utilities: an ever-widening diversity of earnings streams, which shield BHE from being seriously harmed byany single regulatory body. These many sources of profit, supplemented by the inherent advantage of thecompany being owned by a strong parent, have allowed BHE and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lowertheir cost of debt. That economic fact benefits both us andour customers. All told, BHE and BNSF invested $8.9 billion in plant and equipment last year, a massive commitmentto their segments of America’s infrastructure. We relish making such investments as long as they promisereasonable returns – and, on that front, we put a large amount of trust in future regulation.Our confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will foreverneed huge investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capitalproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is concomitantly in ourself-interest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people theyrepresent.Low prices are a powerful way to keep these constituencies happy. In Iowa, BHE’s average retail rate is7.1¢ per KWH. Alliant, the other major electric utility in the state, averages 9.9¢. Here are the comparableindustry figures for adjacent states: Nebraska 9.0¢, Missouri 9.5¢, Illinois 9.2¢, Minnesota 10.0¢. The nationalaverage is 10.3¢. We have promised Iowans that our base rates will not increase until 2029 at the earliest. Our rock-bottom prices add up to real money for paycheck-strapped customers.At BNSF, price comparisons between major railroads are far more difficult to make because ofsignificant differences in both their mix of cargo and the average distance the load is carried. To supply a very crude measure, however, our revenue per ton-mile was 3¢ last year, while shipping costs for customers of theother four major U.S.-based railroads ranged from 4¢ to 5¢.Both BHE and BNSF have been leaders in pursuing planet-friendly technology. In wind generation, nostate comes close to rivaling Iowa, where last year the megawatt-hours we generated from wind equaled 55% ofall megawatt-hours sold to our Iowa retail customers. New wind projects that are underway will take that figureto 89% by 2020.Bargain-basement electric rates carry second-order benefits with them. Iowa has attracted large high-tech installations, both because of its low prices for electricity (which data centers use in huge quantities) andbecause most tech CEOs are enthusiastic about using renewable energy. When it comes to wind energy, Iowa isthe Saudi Arabia of America.BNSF, like other Class I railroads, uses only a single gallon of diesel fuel to move a ton of freightalmost 500 miles. Those economics make railroads four times as fuel-efficient as trucks! Furthermore, railroadsalleviate highway congestion – and the taxpayer-funded maintenance expenditures that come with heaviertraffic – in a major way.
12All told, BHE and BNSF own assets that are of major importance to our country as well as toshareholders of Berkshire. Here are the key financial figures for both:BNSF

But it came with our purchase ofMidAmerican (now BHE) in 1999 – and we are lucky that it did.HomeServices owns 38 realty companies with more than 29,000 agents who operate in 28 states. Lastyear it purchased four realtors, including Houlihan Lawrence, the leader in New York’s Westchester County (in atransaction that closed shortly after yearend).In real estate parlance, representing either a buyer or a seller is called a “side,” with the representation ofboth counting as two sides. Last year, ourownedrealtors participated in 244,000 sides, totaling $86 billion in volume.HomeServices alsofranchisesmany operations throughout the country that use our name. We like bothaspects of the real estate business and expect to acquire many realtors and franchisees during the next decade.

Included in this financial summary are 44 businesses that report directly to headquarters. But some ofthese companies, in turn, have many individual operations under their umbrella. For example, Marmon has 175separate business units, serving widely disparate markets, and Berkshire Hathaway Automotive owns 83dealerships, operating in nine states.This collection of businesses is truly a motley crew. Some operations, measured by earnings onunleveraged nettangibleassets, enjoy terrific returns that, in a couple of instances, exceed 100%. Most are solidbusinesses generating good returns in the area of 12% to 20%.
14A few, however – these are serious blunders I made in my job of capital allocation – produce very poorreturns. In most cases, I was wrong when I originally sized up the economic characteristics of these companies orthe industries in which they operate, and we are now paying the price for my misjudgments. In a couple ofinstances, I stumbled in assessing either the fidelity or ability of incumbent managers or ones I later put in place.I will commit more errors; you can count on that. Fortunately, Charlie – never bashful – is around to say “no” tomy worst ideas.Viewed as a single entity, the companies in the manufacturing, service and retailing group are anexcellent business. They employed an average of $24 billion of net tangible assets during 2016 and, despite theirholding large quantities of excess cash and carrying very little debt, earned 24% after-tax on that capital.Of course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if it is bought at too high a price.We have paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in thelarge figure we show on our balance sheet for goodwill and other intangibles. Overall, however, we are getting adecent return on the capital we have deployed in this sector. Absent a recession, earnings from the group willlikely grow in 2017, in part because Duracell and Precision Castparts (both bought in 2016) will for the first timecontribute a full year’s earnings to this group. Additionally, Duracell incurred significant transitional costs in2016 that will not recur.We have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, theircompetitors – both current and potential – read this report. In a few of our businesses, we might be disadvantagedif outsiders knew our numbers. Therefore, in certain of our operations that are not of a size material to anevaluation of Berkshire, we only disclose what is required. You can nevertheless find a good bit of detail aboutmany of our operations on pages 90 - 94. Be aware, though, that it’s the growth of the Berkshire forest thatcounts. It would be foolish to focus over-intently on any single tree.************For several years I have told you that the income and expense data shown in this section does notconform to GAAP. I have explained that this divergence occurs primarily because of GAAP-ordered rulesregarding purchase-accounting adjustments that require the full amortization of certain intangibles over periodsaveraging about 19 years. In our opinion, most of those amortization “expenses” are not truly an economic cost.Our goal in diverging from GAAP in this section is to present the figures to you in a manner reflecting the way inwhich Charlie and I view and analyze them.On page 54 we itemize $15.4 billion of intangibles that are yet to be amortized by annual charges toearnings. (More intangibles to be amortized will be created as we make new acquisitions.) On that page, we showthat the 2016 amortization charge to GAAP earnings was $1.5 billion, up $384 million from 2015. My judgmentis that about 20% of the 2016 charge is a “real” cost.Eventually amortization charges fully write off the related asset. When that happens – most often at the15-year mark – the GAAP earnings we report will increase without any true improvement in the underlyingeconomics of Berkshire’s business. (My gift to my successor.)Now that I’ve described a GAAP expense that I believe to be overstated, let me move on to a lesspleasant distortion produced by accounting rules. The subject this time is GAAP-prescribed depreciation charges,which are necessarily based on historical cost. Yet in certain cases, those charges materially understatetrue economic costs. Countless words were written about this phenomenon in the 1970s and early 1980s, wheninflation was rampant. As inflation subsided – thanks to heroic actions by Paul Volcker – the inadequacy ofdepreciation charges became less of an issue. But the problem still prevails, big time, in the railroad industry, where current costs for many depreciable items far outstrip historical costs. The inevitable result is that reportedearnings throughout the railroad industry are considerably higher than true economic earnings.
15At BNSF, to get down to particulars, our GAAP depreciation charge last year was $2.1 billion. But werewe to spend that sum and no more annually, our railroad would soon deteriorate and become less competitive.The reality is that –simply to hold our own– we need to spend far more than the cost we show for depreciation.Moreover, a wide disparity will prevail for decades.All that said, Charlie and I love our railroad, which was one of our better purchases.************Too many managements – and the number seems to grow every year – are looking for any means toreport,and indeed feature, “adjusted earnings” that are higher than their company’s GAAP earnings. There aremany ways for practitioners to perform this legerdemain. Two of their favorites are the omission of“restructuring costs” and “stock-based compensation” as expenses.Charlie and Iwantmanagements,in their commentary, to describe unusual items – good or bad – that affect the GAAP numbers. After all, the reason we look at these numbers of the past is to make estimates of thefuture. But a management that regularly attempts to wave away very real costs by highlighting “adjustedper-share earnings” makes us nervous. That’s because bad behavior is contagious: CEOs who overtly look forways to report high numbers tend to foster a culture in which subordinates strive to be “helpful” as well. Goalslike that can lead, for example, to insurers underestimating their loss reserves, a practice that has destroyed manyindustry participants.Charlie and I cringe when we hear analysts talk admiringly about managements who always “make thenumbers.” In truth, business is too unpredictable for the numbers always to be met. Inevitably, surprises occur.When they do, a CEO whose focus is centered on Wall Street will be tempted to make upthe numbers. Let’s get back to the two favorites of “don’t-count-this” managers, starting with “restructuring.”Berkshire, I would say, has been restructuring from the first day we took over in 1965. Owning only a northerntextile business then gave us no other choice. And today a fair amount of restructuring occurs every year atBerkshire. That’s because there are always things that need to change in our hundreds of businesses. Last year, asI mentioned earlier, we spent significant sums getting Duracell in shape for the decades ahead.We have never, however, singled out restructuring charges and told you to ignore them in estimating ournormal earning power. If there were to be some truly major expenses in a single year, I would, of course, mentionit in my commentary. Indeed, when there is a total rebasing of a business, such as occurred when Kraft and Heinzmerged, it is imperative that for several years the huge one-time costs of rationalizing the combined operations beexplained clearly to owners. That’s precisely what the CEO of Kraft Heinz has done, in a manner approved bythe company’s directors (who include me). But, to tell owners year after year, “Don’t count this,” whenmanagement is simply making business adjustments that are necessary, is misleading. And too many analysts andjournalists fall for this baloney.To say “stock-based compensation” is not an expense is even more cavalier. CEOs who go down thatroad are, in effect, saying to shareholders, “If you pay me a bundle in options or restricted stock, don’t worryabout its effect on earnings. I’ll ‘adjust’ it away.”To explore this maneuver further, join me for a moment in a visit to a make-believe accountinglaboratory whose sole mission is to juice Berkshire’s reportedearnings. Imaginative technicians await us, eager to show their stuff.
16Listen carefully while I tell these enablers that stock-based compensation usually comprises at least 20%of total compensation for the top three or four executives at most large companies. Pay attention, too, as I explainthat Berkshire has several hundred such executives at its subsidiaries and pays them similar amounts, but usesonly cash to do so. I further confess that, lacking imagination, I have counted allof these payments to Berkshire’s executives as an expense.My accounting minions suppress a giggle and immediately point out that 20% of what is paid theseBerkshire managers is tantamount to “cash paid in lieu of stock-based compensation” and is therefore not a“true” expense. So – presto! – Berkshire, too, can have “adjusted” earnings.Back to reality: If CEOs want to leave out stock-based compensation in reporting earnings, they shouldbe required to affirmto their ownersone of two propositions: why items of value used to pay employees are not acost or why a payroll cost should be excluded when calculating earnings.During the accounting nonsense that flourished during the 1960s, the story was told of a CEO who, ashis company revved up to go public, asked prospective auditors, “What is two plus two?” The answer that wonthe assignment, of course, was, “What number do you have in mind?”Finance and Financial ProductsOur three leasing and rental operations are conducted by CORT (furniture), XTRA (semi-trailers), andMarmon (primarily tank cars but also freight cars, intermodal tank containers and cranes). Each is the leader inits field.We also include Clayton Homes in this section. This company receives most of its revenue from the saleof manufactured homes, but derives the bulk of its earningsfrom its large mortgage portfolio. Last year, Clayton became America’s largest home builder, delivering 42,075 units that accounted for 5% of all new Americanhomes. (In fairness, other large builders do far more dollarvolume than Clayton because they sell site-built homes that command much higher prices.)In 2015, Clayton branched out, purchasing its first site-builder. Two similar acquisitions followed in2016, and more will come. Site-built houses are expected to amount to 3% or so of Clayton’s unit sales in 2017and will likely deliver about 14% of its dollar volume.Even so, Clayton’s focus will always be manufactured homes, which account for about 70% of newAmerican homes costing less than $150,000. Clayton manufactures close to one-half of the total. That is a far cryfrom Clayton’s position in 2003 when Berkshire purchased the company. It then ranked third in the industry inunits sold and employed 6,731 people. Now, when its new acquisitions are included, the employee count is14,677. And that number will increase in the future.Clayton’s earnings in recent years have materially benefited from extraordinarily low interest rates. Thecompany’s mortgage loans to home-buyers are at fixed-rates and for long terms (averaging 25 years atinception). But Clayton’s own borrowings are short-term credits that re-price frequently. When rates plunge,Clayton’s earnings from its portfolio greatly increase. We normally would shun that kind of lend-long, borrow-short approach, which can cause major problems for financial institutions. As a whole, however, Berkshire isalways asset-sensitive, meaning that higher short-term rates will benefit our consolidatedearnings, even as they hurt at Clayton.
17Last year Clayton had to foreclose on 8,304 manufactured-housing mortgages, about 2.5% of its totalportfolio. Customer demographics help explain that percentage. Clayton’s customers are usually lower-incomefamilies with mediocre credit scores; many are supported by jobs that will be at risk in any recession; many,similarly, have financial profiles that will be damaged by divorce or death to an extent that would not be typicalfor a high-income family. Those risks that our customers face are partly mitigated because almost all have astrong desire to own a home and because they enjoy reasonable monthly payments that average only $587,includingthe cost of insurance and property taxes.Clayton also has long had programs that help borrowers through difficulties. The two most popular areloan extensions and payment forgiveness. Last year about 11,000 borrowers received extensions, and 3,800 had$3.4 million of scheduled payments permanently canceled by Clayton. The company does not earn interest orfees when these loss-mitigation moves are made. Our experience is that 93% of borrowers helped through theseprograms in the last two years now remain in their homes. Since we lose significant sums onforeclosures – losses last year totaled $150 million – our assistance programs end up helping Clayton as well asits borrowers.Clayton and Berkshire have been a wonderful partnership. Kevin Clayton came to us with a best-in-classmanagement group and culture. Berkshire, in turn, provided unmatched staying power when the manufactured-home industry fell apart during the Great Recession. (As other lenders to the industry vanished, Clayton suppliedcredit not only to its own dealers but also to dealers who sold the products of its competitors.) At Berkshire, wenever count on synergies when we acquire companies. Truly important ones, however, surfaced after ourpurchase of Clayton.Marmon’s railcar business experienced a major slowdown in demand last year, which will causeearnings to decline in 2017. Fleet utilization was 91% in December, down from 97% a year earlier, with the dropparticularly severe at the large fleet we purchased from General Electric in 2015. Marmon’s crane and containerrentals have weakened as well.Big swings in railcar demand have occurred in the past and they will continue. Nevertheless, we verymuch like this business and expect decent returns on equity capital over the years. Tank cars are Marmon’sspecialty. People often associate tank cars with the transportation of crude oil; in fact, they are essential to a greatvariety of shippers.Over time, we expect to expand our railcar operation. Meanwhile, Marmon is making a number ofbolt-on acquisitions whose results are included in the Manufacturing, Service and Retailing section.Here’s thepre-tax earnings recap for our finance-related companies: 2016

* Excludes shares held by pension funds of Berkshire subsidiaries.** This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP “cost” differs in a few cases because ofwrite-downs that have been required under GAAP rules.Some of the stocks in the table are the responsibility of either Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, who workwith me in managing Berkshire’s investments. Each, independently, manages more than $10 billion; I usually learn about decisions they have made by looking at monthly trade sheets. Included in the $21 billion that the twomanage is about $7.6 billion of pension trust assets of certain Berkshire subsidiaries. As noted, pensioninvestments are not included in the preceding tabulation of Berkshire holdings.************Excluded from the table –but important– is our ownership of $5 billion of preferred stock issued by Bank of America. This stock, which pays us $300 million per year, also carries with it a valuable warrantallowing Berkshire to purchase 700 million common shares of Bank of America for $5 billion at any time beforeSeptember 2, 2021. At yearend, that privilege would have delivered us a profit of $10.5 billion. If it wishes,Berkshire can use its preferred shares to satisfy the $5 billion cost of exercising the warrant.
19If the dividend rate on Bank of America common stock – now 30 cents annually – should rise above44 cents before 2021, we would anticipate making a cashless exchange of our preferred into common. If thecommon dividend remains below 44 cents, it is highly probable that we will exercise the warrant immediatelybefore it expires.Many of our investees, including Bank of America, have been repurchasing shares, some quiteaggressively. We very much like this behavior because we believe the repurchased shares have in most casesbeen underpriced. (Undervaluation, after all, is why we own these positions.) When a company grows andoutstanding shares shrink, good things happen for shareholders.************It’s important for you to understand that 95% of the $86 billion of “cash and equivalents” (which in mymind includes U.S. Treasury Bills) shown on our balance sheet are held by entities in the United States and,consequently, is not subject to any repatriation tax. Moreover, repatriation of the remaining funds would triggeronly minor taxes because much of that money has been earned in countries that themselves impose meaningfulcorporate taxes. Those payments become an offset to U.S. tax when money is brought home.These explanations are important because many cash-rich American companies hold a large portion oftheir funds in jurisdictions imposing very low taxes. Such companies hope – and may well be proved right – thatthe tax levied for bringing these funds to America will soon be materially reduced. In the meantime, thesecompanies are limited as to how they can use that cash. In other words, off-shore cash is simply not worth asmuch as cash held at home.Berkshire has a partial offset to the favorable geographical location of its cash, which is that much of itis held in our insurance subsidiaries. Though we have many alternatives for investing this cash, we do not havethe unlimited choices that we would enjoy if the cash were held by the parent company, Berkshire. We dohave an ability annually to distribute large amounts of cash from our insurers to the parent – though here, too, there arelimits. Overall, cash held at our insurers is a very valuable asset, but one slightly less valuable to us than is cashheld at the parent level.************Sometimes the comments of shareholders or media imply that we will own certain stocks “forever.” It istrue that we own some stocks that I have no intention of selling for as far as the eye can see (and we’re talking20/20 vision). But we have made nocommitmentthat Berkshire will holdanyof its marketable securities forever. Confusion about this point may have resulted from a too-casual reading of Economic Principle 11 onpages 110 - 111, which has been included in our annual reports since 1983. That principle covers controlled businesses, not marketable securities. This year I’ve added a final sentence to #11 to ensure that our ownersunderstand that we regard any marketable security as available for sale, however unlikely such a sale now seems.************Before we leave this investment section, a few educational words about dividends and taxes: Berkshire,like most corporations, nets considerablymorefrom a dollar of dividends than it reaps from a dollar of capitalgains. That will probably surprise those of our shareholders who are accustomed to thinking of capital gains asthe route to tax-favored returns.But here’s thecorporatemath. Every $1 of capital gains that a corporation realizes carries with it35 cents of federal income tax (and often state income tax as well). The tax on dividends received from domestic corporations, however, is consistently lower, though rates vary depending on the status of the recipient.
20For a non-insurance company – which describes Berkshire Hathaway, the parent – the federal tax rate iseffectively 10
1⁄2cents per $1 of dividends received. Furthermore, a non-insurance company that owns more than20% of an investee owes taxes of only 7 cents per $1 of dividends. That rate applies, for example, to thesubstantial dividends we receive from our 27% ownership of Kraft Heinz, all of it held by the parent company.(The rationale for the low corporate taxes on dividends is that the dividend-paying investee has already paid itsown corporate tax on the earnings being distributed.)Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries pay a tax rate on dividends that is somewhat higher than that applyingto non-insurance companies, though the rate is still well below the 35% hitting capital gains. Property/casualtycompanies owe about 14% in taxes on most dividends they receive. Their tax rate falls, though, to about 11% ifthey own more than 20% of a U.S.-based investee.And that’s our tax lesson for today.“The Bet” (or how your money finds its way to Wall Street)In this section, you will encounter, early on, the story of an investment bet I made nine years ago and,next, some strong opinions I have about investing. As a starter, though, I want to briefly describe Long Bets, aunique establishment that played a role in the bet.Long Bets was seeded by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and operates as a non-profit organization thatadministers just what you’d guess: long-term bets. To participate, “proposers” post a proposition at Longbets.orgthat will be proved right or wrong at a distant date. They then wait for a contrary-minded party to take the otherside of the bet. When a “doubter” steps forward, each side names a charity that will be the beneficiary if its sidewins; parks its wager with Long Bets; and posts a short essay defending its position on the Long Bets website.When the bet is concluded, Long Bets pays off the winning charity.Here are examples of what you will find on Long Bets’ very interesting site:In 2002, entrepreneur Mitch Kapor asserted that “By 2029 no computer – or ‘machine intelligence’ – willhave passed the Turing Test,” which deals with whether a computer can successfully impersonate a human being.Inventor Ray Kurzweil took the opposing view. Each backed up his opinion with $10,000. I don’t know who willwin this bet, but I will confidently wager that no computer will ever replicate Charlie.That same year, Craig Mundie of Microsoft asserted that pilotless planes would routinely fly passengersby 2030, while Eric Schmidt of Google argued otherwise. The stakes were $1,000 each. To ease any heartburnEric might be experiencing from his outsized exposure, I recently offered to take a piece of his action. Hepromptly laid off $500 with me. (I like his assumption that I’ll be around in 2030 to contribute my payment,should we lose.)Now, to my bet and its history. In Berkshire’s 2005 annual report, I argued that active investmentmanagement by professionals – in aggregate – would over a period of years underperform the returns achieved byrank amateurs who simply sat still. I explained that the massive fees levied by a variety of “helpers” would leavetheir clients –again in aggregate– worse off than if the amateurs simply invested in an unmanaged low-cost indexfund. (See pages 114 - 115 for a reprint of the argument as I originally stated it in the 2005 report.)
21Subsequently, I publicly offered to wager $500,000 that no investment pro could select a set of at leastfive hedge funds – wildly-popular and high-fee investing vehicles – that would over an extended period matchthe performance of an unmanaged S&P-500 index fund charging only token fees. I suggested a ten-year bet andnamed a low-cost Vanguard S&P fund as my contender. I then sat back and waited expectantly for a parade offund managers – who could include their own fund as one of the five – to come forth and defend theiroccupation. After all, these managers urgedothersto bet billions on their abilities. Why should they fear putting a little of their own money on the line?What followed was the sound of silence. Though there are thousands of professional investment managerswho have amassed staggering fortunes by touting their stock-selecting prowess, only one man – Ted Seides –stepped up to my challenge. Ted was a co-manager of Protégé Partners, an asset manager that had raised moneyfrom limited partners to form a fund-of-funds – in other words, a fund that invests in multiple hedge funds.I hadn’t known Ted before our wager, but I like him and admire his willingness to put his money wherehis mouth was. He has been both straight-forward with me and meticulous in supplying all the data that both heand I have needed to monitor the bet.For Protégé Partners’ side of our ten-year bet, Ted picked five funds-of-funds whose results were to beaveraged and compared against my Vanguard S&P index fund. The five he selected had invested their money inmore than 100 hedge funds, which meant that the overall performance of the funds-of-funds would not bedistorted by the good or poor results of a single manager.Each fund-of-funds, of course, operated with a layer of fees that sat above the fees charged by the hedgefunds in which it had invested. In this doubling-up arrangement, the larger fees were levied by the underlyinghedge funds; each of the fund-of-funds imposed an additional fee for its presumed skills in selecting hedge-fundmanagers.Here are the results for the first nine years of the bet – figures leaving no doubt that Girls Inc. of Omaha,the charitable beneficiary I designated to get any bet winnings I earned, will be the organization eagerly openingthe mail next January.Year

I, however, see their annual audits.The compounded annual increase to date for the index fund is 7.1%, which is a return that could easilyprove typical for the stock market over time. That’s an important fact: A particularly weak nine years for themarket over the lifetime of this bet would have probably helped the relative performance of the hedge funds,because many hold large “short” positions. Conversely, nine years of exceptionally high returns from stockswould have provided a tailwind for index funds.Instead we operated in what I would call a “neutral” environment. In it, the five funds-of-fundsdelivered, through 2016, an average of only 2.2%, compounded annually. That means $1 million invested inthose funds would have gained $220,000. The index fund would meanwhile have gained $854,000. 22Bear in mind that every one of the 100-plus managers of the underlying hedge funds had a hugefinancial incentive to do his or her best. Moreover, the five funds-of-funds managers that Ted selected weresimilarly incentivized to select the best hedge-fund managers possible because the five were entitled toperformance fees based on the results of the underlying funds.I’m certain that in almost all cases the managers at both levels were honest and intelligent people. Butthe results for their investors were dismal –reallydismal. And, alas, the huge fixed fees charged by all of the funds and funds-of-funds involved – fees that were totally unwarranted by performance – were such that theirmanagers were showered with compensation over the nine years that have passed. As Gordon Gekko might haveput it: “Fees never sleep.”The underlying hedge-fund managers in our bet received payments from their limited partners thatlikely averaged a bit under the prevailing hedge-fund standard of “2 and 20,” meaning a 2% annual fixed fee,payable even when losses are huge, and 20% of profits with no clawback (if good years were followed by badones). Under this lopsided arrangement, a hedge fund operator’s ability to simply pile up assets undermanagement has made many of these managers extraordinarily rich, even as their investments have performedpoorly.Still, we’re not through with fees. Remember, there were the fund-of-funds managers to be fed as well.These managers received an additional fixed amount that was usually set at 1% of assets. Then, despite theterrible overall record of the five funds-of-funds, some experienced a few good years and collected“performance” fees. Consequently, I estimate that over the nine-year period roughly 60% – gulp! – of allgains achieved by the five funds-of-funds were diverted to the two levels of managers. That was their misbegottenreward for accomplishing something far short of what their many hundreds of limited partners could haveeffortlessly – and with virtuallynocost – achieved on their own.In my opinion, the disappointing results for hedge-fund investors that this bet exposed are almost certainto recur in the future. I laid out my reasons for that belief in a statement that was posted on the Long Bets websitewhen the bet commenced (and that is still posted there). Here is what I asserted:Over a ten-year period commencing on January 1, 2008, and ending on December 31, 2017,the S&P 500 will outperform a portfolio of funds of hedge funds, when performance ismeasured on a basis net of fees, costs and expenses.A lot of very smart people set out to do better than average in securities markets. Call themactive investors.Their opposites, passive investors, will by definition do about average. In aggregate theirpositions will more or less approximate those of an index fund. Therefore, the balance ofthe universe—the active investors—must do about average as well. However, theseinvestors will incur far greater costs. So, on balance, their aggregate results after these costswill be worse than those of the passive investors.Costs skyrocket when large annual fees, large performance fees, and active trading costs areall added to the active investor’s equation. Funds of hedge funds accentuate this costproblem because their fees are superimposed on the large fees charged by the hedge fundsin which the funds of funds are invested.A number of smart people are involved in running hedge funds. But to a great extent theirefforts are self-neutralizing, and their IQ will not overcome the costs they impose oninvestors. Investors, on average and over time, will do better with a low-cost index fundthan with a group of funds of funds.
23So that was my argument – and now let me put it into a simple equation. If Group A (active investors)and Group B (do-nothing investors) comprise the total investing universe, and B is destined to achieve averageresults before costs, so, too, must A. Whichever group has the lower costs will win. (The academic in me requiresme to mention that there is a very minor point – not worth detailing – that slightlymodifies this formulation.) And if Group A has exorbitant costs, its shortfall will be substantial.There are, of course, some skilled individuals who are highly likely to out-perform the S&P over longstretches. In my lifetime, though, I’ve identified – early on– only ten or so professionals that I expected would accomplish this feat.There are no doubt many hundreds of people – perhaps thousands – whom I have never met and whoseabilities would equal those of the people I’ve identified. The job, after all, is not impossible. The problem simplyis that the great majority of managers who attempt to over-perform will fail. The probability is also very high thatthe person soliciting your funds will not be the exception who does well. Bill Ruane – a truly wonderful humanbeing and a man whom I identified 60 years ago as almost certain to deliver superior investment returns over thelong haul – said it well: “In investment management, the progression is from the innovators to the imitators to theswarming incompetents.”Further complicating the search for the rare high-fee manager who is worth his or her pay is the fact thatsome investment professionals, just as some amateurs, will be lucky over short periods. If 1,000 managers makea market prediction at the beginning of a year, it’s very likely that the calls of at least one will be correct for nineconsecutive years. Of course, 1,000 monkeys would be just as likely to produce a seemingly all-wise prophet.But therewouldremain a difference: The lucky monkey would not find people standing in line to invest withhim.Finally, there are three connected realities that cause investing success to breed failure. First, a goodrecord quickly attracts a torrent of money. Second, huge sums invariably act as an anchor on investmentperformance: What is easy with millions, struggles with billions (sob!). Third, most managers will neverthelessseek new money because of theirpersonalequation – namely, the more funds they have under management, themore their fees.These three points are hardly new ground for me: In January 1966, when I was managing $44 million,I wrote my limited partners: “I feel substantially greater size is more likely to harm future results than to helpthem. This might not be true for my own personal results, but it is likely to be true for your results. Therefore, . . .I intend to admit no additional partners to BPL. I have notified Susie that if we have any more children, it is up toher to find some other partnership for them.”The bottom line: When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it willusually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients. Both large and small investors should stickwith low-cost index funds.************If a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the hands-down choice should be Jack Bogle. For decades, Jack has urged investors to invest in ultra-low-cost index funds.In his crusade, he amassed only a tiny percentage of the wealth that has typically flowed to managers who havepromised their investors large rewards while delivering them nothing – or, as in our bet, lessthan nothing – of added value.In his early years, Jack was frequently mocked by the investment-management industry. Today,however, he has the satisfaction of knowing that he helped millions of investors realize far better returns on theirsavings than they otherwise would have earned. He is a hero to them and to me.************Over the years, I’ve often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I’velearned a good deal about human behavior. My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&P 500 indexfund. To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion. 24I believe, however, thatnoneof the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followedthat same advice when I’ve given it to them. Instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts anddepart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out anotherbreed of hyper-helper called a consultant.That professional, however, faces a problem. Can you imagine an investment consultant telling clients,year after year, to keep adding to an index fund replicating the S&P 500? That would be career suicide. Largefees flow to these hyper-helpers, however, if they recommend small managerial shifts every year or so. Thatadvice is often delivered in esoteric gibberish that explains why fashionable investment “styles” or currenteconomic trends make the shift appropriate.The wealthy are accustomed to feeling that it is their lot in life to get the best food, schooling,entertainment, housing, plastic surgery, sports ticket, you name it. Their money, they feel, should buy themsomething superior compared to what the masses receive.In many aspects of life, indeed, wealth does command top-grade products or services. For that reason,the financial “elites” – wealthy individuals, pension funds, college endowments and the like – have great troublemeekly signing up for a financial product or service that is available as well to people investing only a fewthousand dollars. This reluctance of the rich normally prevails even though the product at issue is –on anexpectancy basis – clearly the best choice. My calculation, admittedly very rough, is that the search by the elitefor superior investment advice has caused it, in aggregate, to waste more than $100 billion over the past decade.Figure it out: Even a 1% fee on a few trillion dollars adds up. Of course, not every investor who put money inhedge funds ten years ago lagged S&P returns. But I believe my calculation of the aggregate shortfall isconservative.Much of the financial damage befell pension funds for public employees. Many of these funds arewoefully underfunded, in part because they have suffered a double whammy: poor investment performanceaccompanied by huge fees. The resulting shortfalls in their assets will for decades have to be made up by localtaxpayers.Human behavior won’t change. Wealthy individuals, pension funds, endowments and the like willcontinue to feel they deserve something “extra” in investment advice. Those advisors who cleverly play to thisexpectation will get very rich. This year the magic potion may be hedge funds, next year something else. Thelikely result from this parade of promises is predicted in an adage: “When a person with money meets a personwith experience, the one with experience ends up with the money and the one with money leaves withexperience.”Long ago, a brother-in-law of mine, Homer Rogers, was a commission agent working in the Omahastockyards. I asked him how he induced a farmer or rancher to hire him to handle the sale of their hogs or cattleto the buyers from the big four packers (Swift, Cudahy, Wilson and Armour). After all, hogs were hogs and thebuyers were experts who knew to the penny how much any animal was worth. How then, I asked Homer, couldany sales agent get a better result than any other?Homer gave me a pitying look and said: “Warren, it’s not how you sell ‘em, it’s how you tell ‘em.”What worked in the stockyards continues to work in Wall Street.************And, finally, let me offer an olive branch to Wall Streeters, many of them good friends of mine.Berkshireloves to pay fees – even outrageous fees – to investment bankers who bring us acquisitions. Moreover,we have paid substantial sums for over-performance to our two in-house investment managers – and we hope tomake even larger payments to them in the future.To get biblical (Ephesians 3:18), I know the height and the depth and the length and the breadth of theenergy flowing from that simple four-letter word – fees – when it is spoken to Wall Street. And when that energydelivers value to Berkshire, I will cheerfully write a big check.25The Annual MeetingLast year we partnered with Yahoo to air the first-ever webcast of our annual meeting. Thanks to AndySerwer and his Yahoo crew, the production was a success in all respects, registering 1.1 million unique visits inreal-time viewing and 11.5 million more in replays (many of those, to be sure, called up by viewers interested inonly certain segments of the webcast).Berkshire’s thank-you mail for initiating the webcast included many notes from three constituencies: theelderly who find travel difficult; the thrifty who find it expensive to travel to Omaha; and those who cannotattend a Saturday meeting for religious reasons.The webcast cut attendance at last year’s meeting to about 37,000 people (we can’t get a precise count),which was down about 10%. Nevertheless, both Berkshire’s subsidiaries and Omaha hotels and restaurantsracked up huge sales. Nebraska Furniture Mart’s sales broke their 2015 record volume by 3%, with the Omahastore recording one-week volume of $45.5 million.Our Berkshire exhibitors at CenturyLink were open from noon until 5 p.m. on Friday and drew a crowdof 12,000 bargain-hunting shareholders. We will repeat those Friday shopping hours this year on May 5
th. Bring money.The annual meeting falls on May 6
thand will again be webcast by Yahoo, whose web address is https://finance.yahoo.com/brklivestream. The webcast will go live at 9 a.m. Central Daylight Time. Yahoo willinterview directors, managers, stockholders and celebrities before the meeting and during the lunch break. Boththose interviews and meeting will be translated simultaneously into Mandarin.For those attending the meeting in person, the doors at the CenturyLink will open at 7:00 a.m. onSaturday to facilitate shopping prior to our shareholder movie, which begins at 8:30. The question-and-answerperiod will start at 9:30 and run until 3:30, with a one-hour lunch break at noon. Finally, at 3:45 we will begin theformal shareholder meeting. It will run an hour or so. That is somewhat longer than usual because three proxyitems are to be presented by their proponents, who will be given a reasonable amount of time to state their case.On Saturday morning, we will have our sixth International Newspaper Tossing Challenge. Our targetwill again be the porch of a Clayton Home, located precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. When I was ateenager – in my one brief flirtation with honest labor – I delivered about 500,000 papers. So I think I’m prettygood at this game. Challenge me! Humiliate me! Knock me down a peg! The papers will run 36 to 42 pages, andyou must fold them yourself (no rubber bands allowed). The competition will begin about 7:45, and I’ll take onten or so competitors selected a few minutes earlier by my assistant, Deb Bosanek.Your venue for shopping will be the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting and in whichproducts from dozens of our subsidiaries will be for sale. Say hello to the many Berkshire managers who will becaptaining their exhibits. And be sure to view the terrific BNSF railroad layout that salutes all of our companies.Your children (and you!) will be enchanted with it.Brooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at themeeting. After you purchase a pair, wear them on Sunday at our fourth annual “Berkshire 5K,” an 8 a.m. racestarting at the CenturyLink. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor’s Guide that will be sentto you with your meeting credentials. Entrants in the race will find themselves running alongside many ofBerkshire’s managers, directors and associates. (Charlie and I, however, will sleep in; the fudge and peanutbrittle we eat throughout the Saturday meeting takes its toll.) Participation in the 5K grows every year. Help usset another record.
26A GEICO booth in the shopping area will be staffed by a number of the company’s top counselors fromaround the country. At last year’s meeting, we set a record for policy sales, up 21% from 2015. I predict we willbe up again this year.So stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount (usually8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental point:The discount is not additive if you qualify for another discount, such as that available to certain groups.) Bringthe details of your existing insurance and check out our price. We can save many of you real money. Spend thesavings on other Berkshire products.Be sure to visit the Bookworm. This Omaha-based retailer will carry about 35 books and DVDs, amongthem a couple of new titles. The best book I read last year was Shoe Dog, by Nike’s Phil Knight. Phil is a very wise, intelligent and competitive fellow who is also a gifted storyteller. The Bookworm will have piles of Shoe Dogas well as several investment classics by Jack Bogle.The Bookworm will once again offer our history of the highlights (and lowlights) of Berkshire’s first 50years. Non-attendees of the meeting can find the book on eBay. Just type in: Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Celebrating 50 years of a Profitable Partnership (2
ndEdition).An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain thecredential you will need for admission to both the meeting and other events. Keep in mind that airlines havesometimes jacked up prices for the Berkshire weekend – though I must admit I have developed some tolerance,bordering on enthusiasm, for that practice now that Berkshire has made large investments in America’s fourmajor carriers. Nevertheless, if you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City vs.Omaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2
1/2hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you significant money. The savings for a couple could run to $1,000 or more. Spend that money with us.At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72
ndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. To obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you mustmake your purchases between Tuesday, May 2
ndand Monday, May 8thinclusive, and must also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigiousmanufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholderweekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. During “Berkshire Weekend,” NFMwill be open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. on Saturday and 10 a.m. to 8p.m. on Sunday. From 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday, NFM is hosting a picnic to which you are all invited.This year we have good news for shareholders in the Kansas City and Dallas metro markets who can’tattend the meeting or perhaps prefer the webcast. From May 2
ndthrough May 8th, shareholders who present meeting credentials or other evidence of their Berkshire ownership (such as brokerage statements) to their localNFM store will receive the same discounts enjoyed by those visiting the Omaha store.At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail receptionfrom 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May 5
th. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 7th, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will remain open until 6 p.m. Remember, the more you buy, the more you save(or so my daughter tells me when we visit the store).
27We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,shareholder prices will be available from Monday, May 1
stthrough Saturday, May 13th. During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder either by presenting your meeting credential or a brokerage statementshowing you own our stock.On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, Norman Beck, a remarkable magician and motivationalspeaker from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. On the upper level, we will have Bob Hamman and SharonOsberg, two of the world’s top bridge experts, available to play with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. Ifthey suggest wagering on the game, change the subject. I will join them at some point and hope Ajit, Charlie andBill Gates will do so also.My friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. Imet Ariel when she was nine, and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Ariel represented theUnited States in the 2012 Olympics. Now, she’s a senior at Princeton (after interning last summer at JPMorganChase). If you don’t mind embarrassing yourself, test your skills against her, beginning at 1 p.m. Bill Gates didpretty well playing Ariel last year, so he may be ready to again challenge her. (My advice: Bet on Ariel.)Gorat’s will be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 7
th, serving from 1 p.m. until 10 p.m. To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call 402-551-3733 on April 3
rd(but not before). Show you are a sophisticated diner by ordering the T-bone with hash browns.We will have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the meeting,asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and theire-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, the preeminent business journalist of her time, who may be e-mailed atloomisbrk@gmail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, ofthe New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the mostinteresting and important to shareholders. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of beingselected if you keep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include nomore than two questions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would likeyour name mentioned if your question is asked.)An accompanying set of questions will be asked by three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year theinsurance specialist will be Jay Gelb of Barclays. Questions that deal with our non-insurance operations willcome from Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Since what wewill be conducting is ashareholders’meeting, our hope is that the analysts and journalists will ask questions thatadd to our owners’ understanding and knowledge of their investment.Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will betough, for sure, and that’s the way we like it. Multi-part questions aren’t allowed; we want to give as manyquestioners as possible a shot at us. Our goal is for you to leave the meeting knowing more about Berkshire thanwhen you came and for you to have a good time while in Omaha.All told, we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist andfor 18 from the audience. The questioners from the audience will be chosen by means of 11 drawings that willtake place at 8:15 a.m. on the morning of the annual meeting. Each of the 11 microphones installed in the arenaand main overflow room will host, so to speak, a drawing.
28While I’m on the subject of our owners’ gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and Ibelieve all shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and, ifpossible, should also have adequate time to digest and analyze it before any trading takes place. That’s why wetry to issue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is always held on aSaturday (a day that also eases traffic and parking problems).We do not follow the common practice of talking one-on-one with large institutional investors oranalysts, treating them instead as we do all other shareholders. There is no one more important to us than theshareholder of limited means who trusts us with a substantial portion of his or her savings. As I run the companyday-to-day – and as I write this letter – that is the shareholder whose image is in my mind.************For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are trulyAll-Stars who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I also believe themindset of our managers to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-ownedcompanies. Most of our managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business “home runs” meansas much to them as their paycheck.Equally important, however, are the men and women who work with me at our corporate office. Thisteam efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 30,450-page Federalincome tax return, oversees the filing of 3,580 state tax returns, responds to countless shareholder and mediainquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country’s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board’sactivities, fact-checks this letter – and the list goes on and on.They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easyand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year, for example, they dealtwith the 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me.They also handle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and Frenchfries (smothered in Heinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. In addition, they cheerfully pitch in to help Carrie Sova –our talented ringmaster at the annual meeting – deliver an interesting and entertaining weekend for ourshareholders. They are proud to work for Berkshire, and I am proud of them.I’m a lucky guy, very fortunate in being surrounded by this excellent staff, a team of highly-talentedoperating managers and a boardroom of very wise and experienced directors. Come to Omaha – the cradle ofcapitalism – on May 6
thand meet the Berkshire Bunch. All of us look forward to seeing you.February 25, 2017 Warren E. Buffett Chairman of the Board

Note:Data are for calendar years with these exceptions: 1965 and 1966, year ended 9/30; 1967, 15 months ended 12/31. Starting in 1979, accountingrules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previouslythe requirement. In this table, Berkshire’s results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the result s are calculated using the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-taxwhereas the Berkshire numbers areafter-tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500 in yearswhen that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return. Over the years,the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.
2BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:Berkshire’s gain in net worth during 2017 was $65.3 billion, which increased the per-share book value ofboth our Class A and Class B stock by 23%. Over the last 53 years (that is, since present management took over), per-share book value has grown from $19 to $211,750, a rate of 19.1% compounded annually.*The format of that opening paragraph has been standard for 30 years. But 2017 was far from standard: Alarge portion of our gain didnotcome from anything we accomplished at Berkshire.The $65 billion gain is nonetheless real – rest assured of that. But only $36 billion came from Berkshire’soperations. The remaining $29 billion was delivered to us in December when Congress rewrote the U.S. Tax Code.(Details of Berkshire’s tax-related gain appear on page K-32 and pages K-89 – K-90.)After stating those fiscal facts, I would prefer to turn immediately to discussing Berkshire’s operations. But,in still another interruption, I must first tell you about a new accounting rule – a generally accepted accountingprinciple (GAAP) – that infuturequarterly and annual reports will severely distort Berkshire’s net income figures andvery often mislead commentators and investors.The new rule says that the net change inunrealizedinvestment gains and losses in stocks we hold must be included in all net income figures we report to you. That requirement will produce some truly wild and capriciousswings in our GAAP bottom-line. Berkshire owns $170 billion of marketable stocks (not including our shares of KraftHeinz), and the value of these holdings can easily swing by $10 billion or more within a quarterly reporting period.Including gyrations of that magnitude in reported net income will swamp the truly important numbers that describe ouroperating performance. For analytical purposes, Berkshire’s “bottom-line” will be useless.The new rule compounds the communication problems we have long had in dealing with the realizedgains (or losses) that accounting rules compel us to include in our net income. In past quarterly and annual press releases,we have regularly warned you not to pay attention to these realized gains, because they – just like our unrealized gains– fluctuate randomly.That’s largely because we sell securities when that seems the intelligent thing to do, not because we are tryingto influence earnings in any way. As a result, we sometimes have reported substantial realized gains for a period whenour portfolio, overall, performed poorly (or the converse).*All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500
thof those shown for the A shares.
3With the new rule about unrealized gains exacerbating the distortion caused by the existing rules applying torealized gains, we will take pains every quarter to explain the adjustments you need in order to make sense of ournumbers. But televised commentary on earnings releases is often instantaneous with their receipt, and newspaperheadlines almost always focus on the year-over-year change in GAAP net income. Consequently, media reportssometimes highlight figures that unnecessarily frighten or encourage many readers or viewers.We will attempt to alleviate this problem by continuing our practice of publishing financial reports late onFriday, well after the markets close, or early on Saturday morning. That will allow you maximum time for analysisand give investment professionals the opportunity to deliver informed commentary before markets open on Monday.Nevertheless, I expect considerable confusion among shareholders for whom accounting is a foreign language.At Berkshire what counts most are increases in our normalized per-share earning power. That metric is whatCharlie Munger, my long-time partner, and I focus on – and we hope that you do, too. Our scorecard for 2017 follows.AcquisitionsThere are four building blocks that add value to Berkshire: (1) sizable stand-alone acquisitions; (2) bolt-onacquisitions that fit with businesses we already own; (3) internal sales growth and margin improvement at our manyand varied businesses; and (4) investment earnings from our huge portfolio of stocks and bonds. In this section, wewill review 2017 acquisition activity.In our search for new stand-alone businesses, the key qualities we seek are durable competitive strengths;able and high-grade management; good returns on the net tangible assets required to operate the business;opportunities for internal growth at attractive returns; and, finally, a sensible purchase price. That last requirement proved a barrier to virtually all deals we reviewed in 2017, as prices for decent, but farfrom spectacular, businesses hit an all-time high. Indeed, price seemed almost irrelevant to an army of optimisticpurchasers.Why the purchasing frenzy? In part, it’s because the CEO job self-selects for “can-do” types. If Wall Streetanalysts or board members urge that brand of CEO to consider possible acquisitions, it’s a bit like telling your ripeningteenager to be sure to have a normal sex life.Once a CEO hungers for a deal, he or she will never lack for forecasts that justify the purchase. Subordinateswill be cheering, envisioning enlarged domains and the compensation levels that typically increase with corporatesize. Investment bankers, smelling huge fees, will be applauding as well. (Don’t ask the barber whether you need ahaircut.) If the historical performance of the target falls short of validating its acquisition, large “synergies” will beforecast. Spreadsheets never disappoint.The ample availability of extraordinarily cheap debt in 2017 further fueled purchase activity. After all, evena high-priced deal will usually boost per-share earnings if it is debt-financed. At Berkshire, in contrast, we evaluateacquisitions on an all-equity basis, knowing that our taste for overall debt is very low and that to assign a large portionof our debt to any individual business would generally be fallacious (leaving aside certain exceptions, such as debtdedicated to Clayton’s lending portfolio or to the fixed-asset commitments at our regulated utilities). We also neverfactor in, nor do we often find, synergies.Our aversion to leverage has dampened our returns over the years. But Charlie and I sleep well. Both of usbelieve it is insane to risk what you have and need in order to obtain what you don’t need. We held this view 50 yearsago when we each ran an investment partnership, funded by a few friends and relatives who trusted us. We also holdit today after a million or so “partners” have joined us at Berkshire.
4Despite our recent drought of acquisitions, Charlie and I believe that from time to time Berkshire will haveopportunities to make very large purchases. In the meantime, we will stick with our simple guideline: The less theprudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we must conduct our own. ************We were able to make one sensible stand-alone purchase last year, a 38.6% partnership interest in Pilot FlyingJ (“PFJ”). With about $20 billion in annual volume, the company is far and away the nation’s leading travel-centeroperator.PFJ has been run from the get-go by the remarkable Haslam family. “Big Jim” Haslam began with a dreamand a gas station 60 years ago. Now his son, Jimmy, manages 27,000 associates at about 750 locations throughoutNorth America. Berkshire has a contractual agreement to increase its partnership interest in PFJ to 80% in 2023;Haslam family members will then own the remaining 20%. Berkshire is delighted to be their partner.When driving on the Interstate, drop in. PFJ sells gasoline as well as diesel fuel, and the food is good. If it’sbeen a long day, remember, too, that our properties have 5,200 showers. ************Let’s move now to bolt-on acquisitions. Some of these were small transactions that I will not detail. Here isan account, however, of a few larger purchases whose closings stretched between late 2016 and early 2018.
Š Clayton Homes acquired two builders of conventional homes during 2017, a move that more than doubledour presence in a field we entered only three years ago. With these additions – Oakwood Homes in Colorado andHarris Doyle in Birmingham – I expect our 2018 site built volume will exceed $1 billion.Clayton’s emphasis, nonetheless, remains manufactured homes, both their construction and their financing.In 2017 Clayton sold 19,168 units through its own retail operation and wholesaled another 26,706 units to independentretailers. All told, Clayton accounted for 49% of the manufactured-home market last year. That industry-leading share– about three times what our nearest competitor did – is a far cry from the 13% Clayton achieved in 2003, the year itjoined Berkshire.Both Clayton Homes and PFJ are based in Knoxville, where the Clayton and Haslam families have long beenfriends. Kevin Clayton’s comments to the Haslams about the advantages of a Berkshire affiliation, and his admiringcomments about the Haslam family to me, helped cement the PFJ deal.
Š Near the end of 2016, Shaw Industries, our floor coverings business, acquired U.S. Floors (“USF”), a rapidlygrowing distributor of luxury vinyl tile. USF’s managers, Piet Dossche and Philippe Erramuzpe, came out of the gatefast, delivering a 40% increase in sales in 2017, during which their operation was integrated with Shaw’s. It’s clearthat we acquired both great human assetsandbusiness assets in making the USF purchase.Vance Bell, Shaw’s CEO, originated, negotiated and completed this acquisition, which increased Shaw’ssales to $5.7 billion in 2017 and its employment to 22,000. With the purchase of USF, Shaw has substantiallystrengthened its position as an important and durable source of earnings for Berkshire.
Š I have told you several times about HomeServices, our growing real estate brokerage operation. Berkshirebacked into this business in 2000 when we acquired a majority interest in MidAmerican Energy (now named BerkshireHathaway Energy). MidAmerican’s activities were then largely in the electric utility field, and I originally paid littleattention to HomeServices.
5But, year-by-year, the company added brokers and, by the end of 2016, HomeServices was the second-largestbrokerage operation in the country – still ranking, though, far behind the leader, Realogy. In 2017, however,HomeServices’ growth exploded. We acquired the industry’s third-largest operator, Long and Foster; number 12,Houlihan Lawrence; and Gloria Nilson.With those purchases we added 12,300 agents, raising our total to 40,950. HomeServices is now close toleading the country in home sales, having participated (including our three acquisitions pro-forma) in $127 billion of“sides” during 2017. To explain that term, there are two “sides” to every transaction; if we represent both buyer andseller, the dollar value of the transaction is counted twice.Despite its recent acquisitions, HomeServices is on track to do only about 3% of the country’s home-brokerage business in 2018. That leaves 97% to go. Given sensible prices, we will keep adding brokers in this mostfundamental of businesses.
Š Finally, Precision Castparts, a company built through acquisitions, bought Wilhelm Schulz GmbH, aGerman maker of corrosion resistant fittings, piping systems and components. Please allow me to skip a furtherexplanation. I don’t understand manufacturing operations as well as I do the activities of real estate brokers, homebuilders or truck stops.Fortunately, I don’t need in this instance to bring knowledge to the table: Mark Donegan, CEO of Precision,is an extraordinary manufacturing executive, and any business in his domain is slated to do well. Betting on peoplecan sometimes be more certain than betting on physical assets.Let’s now move on to operations, beginning with property-casualty (“p/c”) insurance, a business I do understand and the engine that for 51 years has powered Berkshire’s growth.InsuranceBefore I discuss our 2017 insurance results, let me remind you of how and why we entered the field. Webegan by purchasing National Indemnity and a smaller sister company for $8.6 million in early 1967. With ourpurchase we received $6.7 million of tangible net worth that, by the nature of the insurance business, we were able todeploy in marketable securities. It was easy to rearrange the portfolio into securities we would otherwise have owned atBerkshire itself. In effect, we were “trading dollars” for the net worth portion of the cost.The $1.9 million premium over net worth that Berkshire paid brought us an insurance business that usuallydelivered an underwriting profit. Even more important, the insurance operation carried with it $19.4 million of “float”– money that belonged to others but was held by our two insurers.Ever since, float has been of great importance to Berkshire. When we invest these funds, all dividends,interest and gains from their deployment belong to Berkshire. (If we experience investment losses, those, of course,are on our tab as well.)Float materializes at p/c insurers in several ways: (1) Premiums are generally paid to the company upfrontwhereas losses occur over the life of the policy, usually a six-month or one-year period; (2) Though some losses, suchas car repairs, are quickly paid, others – such as the harm caused by exposure to asbestos – may take many years tosurface and even longer to evaluate and settle; (3) Loss payments are sometimes spread over decades in cases, say, ofa person employed by one of our workers’ compensation policyholders being permanently injured and thereafterrequiring expensive lifetime care.
6Float generally grows as premium volume increases. Additionally, certain p/c insurers specialize in lines ofbusiness such as medical malpractice or product liability – business labeled “long-tail” in industry jargon – thatgenerate far more float than, say, auto collision and homeowner policies, which require insurers to almost immediatelymake payments to claimants for needed repairs.Berkshire has been a leader in long-tail business for many years. In particular, we have specialized in jumboreinsurancepolicies that leave us assuming long-tail losses already incurred by other p/c insurers. As a result of ouremphasizing that sort of business, Berkshire’s growth in float has been extraordinary. We are now the country’s secondlargest p/c company measured by premium volume and its leader, by far, in float.Here’s the record: (in $ millions) Year
Premium Volume Float
1970 $ 39 $ 391980 185 2371990 582 1,6322000 19,343 27,8712010 30,749 65,8322017 60,597 114,500Our 2017 volume was boosted by a huge deal in which we reinsured up to $20 billion of long-tail losses thatAIG had incurred. Our premium for this policy was $10.2 billion, a world’s record and one we won’t come close torepeating. Premium volume will therefore fall somewhat in 2018.Float will probably increase slowly for at least a few years. When we eventually experience a decline, it willbe modest – at most 3% or so in any single year. Unlike bank deposits or life insurance policies containing surrenderoptions, p/c float can’t be withdrawn. This means that p/c companies can’t experience massive “runs” in times ofwidespread financial stress, a characteristic of prime importance to Berkshire that we factor into our investmentdecisions.Charlie and Ineverwill operate Berkshire in a manner that depends on the kindness of strangers – or eventhat of friends who may be facing liquidity problems of their own. During the 2008-2009 crisis, we liked havingTreasury Bills –loadsof Treasury Bills – that protected us from having to rely on funding sources such as bank linesor commercial paper. We have intentionally constructed Berkshire in a manner that will allow it to comfortablywithstand economic discontinuities, including such extremes as extended market closures. ************The downside of float is that it comes with risk, sometimes oceans of risk. What looks predictable in insurancecan be anything but. Take the famous Lloyds insurance market, which produced decent results for three centuries. Inthe 1980’s, though, huge latent problems from a few long-tail lines of insurance surfaced at Lloyds and, for a time,threatened to destroy its storied operation. (It has, I should add, fully recovered.)Berkshire’s insurance managers are conservative and careful underwriters, who operate in a culture that haslong prioritized those qualities. That disciplined behavior has produced underwriting profits in most years, and in suchinstances, our cost of float was less than zero. In effect, we got paidthen for holding the huge sums tallied in the earlier table.I have warned you, however, that we have been fortunate in recent years and that the catastrophe-light periodthe industry was experiencing was not a new norm. Last September drove home that point, as three significanthurricanes hit Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.
7My guess at this time is that the insured losses arising from the hurricanes are $100 billion or so. That figure,however, could befaroff the mark. The pattern with most mega-catastrophes has been that initial loss estimates ranlow. As well-known analyst V.J. Dowling has pointed out, the loss reserves of an insurer are similar to a self-gradedexam. Ignorance, wishful thinking or, occasionally, downright fraud can deliver inaccurate figures about an insurer’sfinancial condition for a very long time.We currently estimate Berkshire’s losses from the three hurricanes to be $3 billion (or about $2 billion aftertax). If both that estimate and my industry estimate of $100 billion are close to accurate, our share of the industry losswas about 3%. I believe that percentage is also what we may reasonably expect to be our share of losses in futureAmerican mega-cats.It’s worth noting that the $2 billion net cost from the three hurricanes reduced Berkshire’s GAAP net worthby less than 1%. Elsewhere in the reinsurance industry there were many companies that suffered losses in net worthranging from 7% to more than 15%. The damage to them could have been farworse: Had Hurricane Irma followed a path through Florida only a bit to the east, insured losses might well have been an additional $100 billion.We believe that the annual probability of a U.S. mega-catastrophe causing $400 billion or more of insuredlosses is about 2%. No one, of course, knows the correct probability. We do know, however, that the risk increasesover time because of growth in both the number and value of structures located in catastrophe-vulnerable areas.No company comes close to Berkshire in being financially prepared for a $400 billion mega-cat. Our shareof such a loss might be $12 billion or so, an amount far below the annual earnings we expect from our non-insuranceactivities. Concurrently, much – indeed, perhaps most – of the p/c world would be out of business. Our unparalleledfinancial strength explains why other p/c insurers come to Berkshire – and onlyBerkshire – when they, themselves, need to purchase huge reinsurance coverages for large payments they may have to make in the far future.Prior to 2017, Berkshire had recorded 14 consecutive years of underwriting profits, which totaled $28.3billion pre-tax. I have regularly told you that I expect Berkshire to attain an underwriting profit in a majority of years,but also to experience losses from time to time. My warning became fact in 2017, as we lost $3.2 billion pre-tax fromunderwriting.A large amount of additional information about our various insurance operations is included in the 10-K atthe back of this report. The only point I will add here is that you have some extraordinary managers working for youat our various p/c operations. This is a business in which there are no trade secrets, patents, or locational advantages.What counts are brains and capital. The managers of our various insurance companies supply the brains and Berkshireprovides the capital. ************For many years, this letter has described the activities of Berkshire’s many other businesses. That discussionhas become both repetitious and partially duplicative of information regularly included in the 10-K that follows theletter. Consequently, this year I will give you a simple summary of our dozens of non-insurance businesses. Additionaldetails can be found on pages K-5 – K-22 and pages K-40 – K-50.Viewed as a group –and excluding investment income– our operations other than insurance delivered pre- tax income of $20 billion in 2017, an increase of $950 million over 2016. About 44% of the 2017 profit came from twosubsidiaries. BNSF, our railroad, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (of which we own 90.2%). You can read moreabout these businesses on pages K-5 – K-10 and pages K-40 – K-44.Proceeding down Berkshire’s long list of subsidiaries, our next five non-insurance businesses, as ranked byearnings (but presented here alphabetically) Clayton Homes, International Metalworking Companies, Lubrizol,Marmon and Precision Castparts had aggregate pre-tax income in 2017 of $5.5 billion, little changed from the $5.4billion these companies earned in 2016.The next five, similarly ranked and listed (Forest River, Johns Manville, MiTek, Shaw and TTI) earned $2.1billion last year, up from $1.7 billion in 2016.8The remaining businesses that Berkshire owns – and there are many – recorded little change in pre-taxincome, which was $3.7 billion in 2017 versus $3.5 billion in 2016.Depreciation charges for all of these non-insurance operations totaled $7.6 billion; capital expenditures were$11.5 billion. Berkshire is always looking for ways to expand its businesses and regularly incurs capital expendituresthat far exceed its depreciation charge. Almost 90% of our investments are made in the United States. America’seconomic soil remains fertile.Amortization charges were an additional $1.3 billion. I believe that in large part this item is not a trueeconomic cost. Partially offsetting this good news is the fact that BNSF (like all other railroads) records depreciationcharges that fall well short of the sums regularly needed to keep the railroad in first-class shape.Berkshire’s goal is to substantially increase the earnings of its non-insurance group. For that to happen, wewill need to make one or more huge acquisitions. We certainly have the resources to do so. At yearend Berkshire held$116.0 billion in cash and U.S. Treasury Bills (whose average maturity was 88 days), up from $86.4 billion at yearend2016. This extraordinary liquidity earns only a pittance and is far beyond the level Charlie and I wish Berkshire tohave. Our smiles will broaden when we have redeployed Berkshire’s excess funds into more productive assets.InvestmentsBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value. We excludeour Kraft Heinz holding – 325,442,152 shares – because Berkshire is part of a control group and therefore mustaccount for this investment on the “equity” method. On its balance sheet, Berkshire carries its Kraft Heinz holding ata GAAP figure of $17.6 billion. The shares had a yearend market value of $25.3 billion, and a cost basis of $9.8 billion. 12/31/17

* Excludes shares held by pension funds of Berkshire subsidiaries.** This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP “cost” differs in a few cases because ofwrite-downs that have been required under GAAP rules.9Some of the stocks in the table are the responsibility of either Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, who work withme in managing Berkshire’s investments. Each, independently of me, manages more than $12 billion; I usually learn about decisions they have made by looking at monthly portfolio summaries. Included in the $25 billion that the twomanage is more than $8 billion of pension trust assets of certain Berkshire subsidiaries. As noted, pension investmentsare not included in the preceding tabulation of Berkshire holdings. ************Charlie and I view the marketable common stocks that Berkshire owns as interests in businesses, not as ticker symbols to be bought or sold based on their “chart” patterns, the “target” prices of analysts or the opinions of mediapundits. Instead, we simply believe that if the businesses of the investees are successful (as we believe most will be)our investments will be successful as well. Sometimes the payoffs to us will be modest; occasionally the cash registerwill ring loudly. And sometimes I will make expensive mistakes. Overall – and over time – we should get decentresults. In America, equity investors have the wind at their back.From our stock portfolio – call our holdings “minority interests” in a diversified group of publicly-ownedbusinesses – Berkshire received $3.7 billion of dividends in 2017. That’s the number included in our GAAP figures,as well as in the “operating earnings” we reference in our quarterly and annual reports.That dividend figure, however,farunderstates the “true” earnings emanating from our stock holdings. Fordecades, we have stated in Principle 6 of our “Owner-Related Business Principles” (page 19) that we expectundistributedearnings of our investees to deliver us at least equivalent earnings by way of subsequent capital gains.Our recognition of capital gains (and losses) will be lumpy, particularly as we conform with the new GAAPrule requiring us to constantly recordunrealizedgains or losses in our earnings. I feel confident, however, that the earnings retained by our investees will over time, and with our investees viewed as a group, translate intocommensurate capital gains for Berkshire.The connection of value-building to retained earnings that I’ve just described will be impossible to detect inthe short term. Stocks surge and swoon, seemingly untethered to any year-to-year buildup in their underlying value.Over time, however, Ben Graham’s oft-quoted maxim proves true: “In the short run, the market is a voting machine;in the long run, however, it becomes a weighing machine.” ************Berkshire, itself, provides some vivid examples of how price randomness in the short term can obscure long-term growth in value. For the last 53 years, the company has built value by reinvesting its earnings and lettingcompound interest work its magic. Year by year, we have moved forward. Yet Berkshire shares have suffered fourtruly major dips. Here are the gory details:
Period High Low Percentage Decrease March 1973-January 1975 93 38 (59.1%)10/2/87-10/27/87 4,250 2,675 (37.1%)6/19/98-3/10/2000 80,900 41,300 (48.9%)9/19/08-3/5/09 147,000 72,400 (50.7%)This table offers the strongest argument I can muster against ever using borrowed money to own stocks.There is simply no telling how far stocks can fall in a short period. Even if your borrowings are small and yourpositions aren’t immediately threatened by the plunging market, your mind may well become rattled by scary headlinesand breathless commentary. And an unsettled mind will not make good decisions.
10In the next 53 years our shares (and others) will experience declines resembling those in the table. No one can tell you when these will happen. The light can at any timego from green to red without pausing at yellow. When major declines occur, however, they offer extraordinary opportunities to those who are not handicappedby debt. That’s the time to heed these lines from Kipling’s If:“If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs . . .If you can wait and not be tired by waiting . . .If you can think – and not make thoughts your aim . . .If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you...Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it.”“The Bet” is Over and Has Delivered an Unforeseen Investment LessonLast year, at the 90% mark, I gave you a detailed report on a ten-year bet I had made on December 19, 2007.(The full discussion from last year’s annual report is reprinted on pages 24 – 26.) Now I have the final tally – and, inseveral respects, it’s an eye-opener.I made the bet for two reasons: (1) to leverage my outlay of $318,250 into a disproportionately larger sumthat – if things turned out as I expected – would be distributed in early 2018 to Girls Inc. of Omaha; and (2) topublicize my conviction that my pick – a virtually cost-free investment in an unmanaged S&P 500 index fund – would,over time, deliver better results than those achieved by most investment professionals, however well-regarded andincentivized those “helpers” may be.Addressing this question is of enormous importance. American investors pay staggering sums annually toadvisors, often incurring several layers of consequential costs. In the aggregate, do these investors get their money’sworth? Indeed, again in the aggregate, do investors get anythingfor their outlays? Protégé Partners, my counterparty to the bet, picked five “funds-of-funds” that it expected to overperformthe S&P 500. That wasnota small sample. Those five funds-of-funds in turn owned interests in more than 200 hedgefunds.Essentially, Protégé, an advisory firm that knew its way around Wall Street, selected five investment expertswho, in turn, employed several hundred other investment experts, each managing his or her own hedge fund. Thisassemblage was an elite crew, loaded with brains, adrenaline and confidence.The managers of the five funds-of-funds possessed a further advantage: They could – and did – rearrangetheir portfolios of hedge funds during the ten years, investing with new “stars” while exiting their positions in hedgefunds whose managers had lost their touch.Every actor on Protégé’s side was highly incentivized: Both the fund-of-funds managers and the hedge-fundmanagers they selected significantly shared in gains, even those achieved simply because the market generally movesupwards. (In100%of the 43 ten-year periods since we took control of Berkshire, years with gains by the S&P 500exceeded loss years.)Those performance incentives, it should be emphasized, were frosting on a huge and tasty cake: Even if thefundslostmoney for their investors during the decade, their managers could grow very rich. That would occur becausefixedfees averaging a staggering 2
1⁄2% of assets or so were paidevery yearby the fund-of-funds’ investors, with part of these fees going to the managers at the five funds-of-funds and the balance going to the 200-plus managers of theunderlying hedge funds.
11Here’s the final scorecard for the bet:Year

I, however, have received their annual audits from Protégé. The 2016 figures for funds A, Band C were revised slightly from those originally reported last year. Fund D was liquidated in 2017; itsaverage annual gain is calculated for the nine years of its operation.The five funds-of-funds got off to a fast start, each beating the index fund in 2008. Then the roof fell in. Inevery oneof the nine years that followed, the funds-of-funds as a whole trailed the index fund.Let me emphasize that there was nothing aberrational about stock-market behavior over the ten-year stretch.If a poll of investment “experts” had been asked late in 2007 for a forecast of long-term common-stock returns, theirguesses would have likely averaged close to the 8.5% actually delivered by the S&P 500. Making money in thatenvironment should have been easy. Indeed, Wall Street “helpers” earned staggering sums. While this groupprospered, however, many of their investors experienced a lost decade.Performance comes, performance goes. Fees never falter.************The bet illuminated another important investment lesson: Though markets are generally rational, theyoccasionally do crazy things. Seizing the opportunities then offered does notrequire great intelligence, a degree in economics or a familiarity with Wall Street jargon such as alpha and beta. What investors then need instead is anability to both disregard mob fears or enthusiasms and to focus on a few simple fundamentals. A willingness to lookunimaginative for a sustained period – or even to look foolish – is also essential.Originally, Protégé and I each funded our portion of the ultimate $1 million prize by purchasing $500,000face amount of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds (sometimes called “strips”). These bonds cost each of us $318,250 –a bit less than 64¢ on the dollar – with the $500,000 payable in ten years.As the name implies, the bonds we acquired paid no interest, but (because of the discount at which they werepurchased) delivered a 4.56% annual return if held to maturity. Protégé and I originally intended to do no more thantally the annual returns and distribute $1 million to the winning charity when the bonds matured late in 2017.
12After our purchase, however, some very strange things took place in the bond market. By November 2012,our bonds – now with about five years to go before they matured – were selling for 95.7%of their face value. Atthat price, their annual yield to maturity was less than 1%. Or, to be precise, .88%. Given that pathetic return, our bonds had become a dumb – a reallydumb – investment compared to American equities. Over time, the S&P 500 – which mirrors a huge cross-section of American business, appropriatelyweighted by market value – has earnedfarmore than 10% annually on shareholders’ equity (net worth).In November 2012, as we were considering all this, the cashreturn from dividends on the S&P 500 was 2
1⁄2% annually, about triple the yield on our U.S. Treasury bond. These dividend payments were almost certain to grow.Beyond that, huge sums were being retained by the companies comprising the 500. These businesses would use theirretained earnings to expand their operations and, frequently, to repurchase their shares as well. Either course would,over time, substantially increase earnings-per-share. And – as has been the case since 1776 – whatever its problems ofthe minute, the American economy was going to move forward.Presented late in 2012 with the extraordinary valuation mismatch between bonds and equities, Protégé andI agreed to sell the bonds we had bought five years earlier and use the proceeds to buy 11,200 Berkshire “B” shares.The result: Girls Inc. of Omaha found itself receiving $2,222,279 last month rather than the $1 million it had originallyhoped for.Berkshire, it should be emphasized, has not performed brilliantly since the 2012 substitution. But brilliancewasn’t needed: After all, Berkshire’s gain only had to beat that annual .88% bond bogey – hardly a Herculeanachievement.The only risk in the bonds-to-Berkshire switch was that yearend 2017 would coincide with an exceptionallyweak stock market. Protégé and I felt this possibility (which alwaysexists) was very low. Two factors dictated this conclusion: The reasonable price of Berkshire in late 2012, and the large asset build-up that was almost certain to occurat Berkshire during the five years that remained before the bet would be settled. Even so, to eliminate allrisk to the charities from the switch, I agreed to make up any shortfall if sales of the 11,200 Berkshire shares at yearend 2017didn’t produce at least $1 million. ************Investing is an activity in which consumption today is foregone in an attempt to allow greater consumptionat a later date. “Risk” is the possibility that this objective won’t be attained.By that standard, purportedly “risk-free” long-term bonds in 2012 were a farriskier investment than a long- term investment in common stocks. At that time, even a 1% annual rate of inflation between 2012 and 2017 wouldhave decreased the purchasing-power of the government bond that Protégé and I sold.I want to quickly acknowledge that inanyupcoming day, week or even year, stocks will be riskier – far riskier – than short-term U.S. bonds. As an investor’s investment horizon lengthens, however, a diversified portfolioof U.S. equities becomes progressivelylessrisky than bonds, assuming that the stocks are purchased at a sensiblemultiple of earnings relative to then-prevailing interest rates.It is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons – among them, pension funds, collegeendowments and savings-minded individuals – to measure their investment “risk” by their portfolio’s ratio of bondsto stocks. Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increaseits risk.************A final lesson from our bet: Stick with big, “easy” decisions and eschew activity. During the ten-year bet,the 200-plus hedge-fund managers that were involved almost certainly made tens of thousands of buy and selldecisions. Most of those managers undoubtedly thought hard about their decisions, each of which they believed wouldprove advantageous. In the process of investing, they studied 10-Ks, interviewed managements, read trade journalsand conferred with Wall Street analysts.13Protégé and I, meanwhile, leaning neither on research, insights nor brilliance, made only one investmentdecision during the ten years. We simply decided to sell our bond investment at a price of more than 100 times earnings(95.7 sale price/.88 yield), those being “earnings” that could not increase during the ensuing five years.We made the sale in order to move our money into a single security – Berkshire – that, in turn, owned adiversified group of solid businesses. Fueled by retained earnings, Berkshire’s growth in value was unlikely to be lessthan 8% annually, even if we were to experience a so-so economy.After that kindergarten-like analysis, Protégé and I made the switch and relaxed, confident that, over time, 8%was certain to beat .88%. By a lot.The Annual MeetingThe annual meeting falls on May 5
thand will again be webcast by Yahoo!, whose web address is https://finance.yahoo.com/brklivestream. The webcast will go live at 8:45 a.m. Central Daylight Time. Yahoo! willinterview directors, managers, stockholders and celebrities before the meeting and during the lunch break. Both theinterviews and meeting will be translated simultaneously into Mandarin.Our partnership with Yahoo! began in 2016 and shareholders have responded enthusiastically. Last year,real-time viewership increased 72% to about 3.1 million and replays of short segments totaled 17.1 million.For those attending the meeting in person, the doors at the CenturyLink will open at 7:00 a.m. on Saturdayto facilitate shopping prior to our shareholder movie, which begins at 8:30. The question-and-answer period will startat 9:15 and run until 3:30, with a one-hour lunch break at noon. Finally, at 3:45 we will begin the formal shareholdermeeting, which usually runs from 15 to 45 minutes. Shopping will end at 4:30.On Friday, May 4
th, our Berkshire exhibitors at CenturyLink will be open from noon until 5 p.m. We addedthat extra shopping time in 2015, and serious shoppers love it. Last year about 12,000 people came through the doorsin the five hours we were open on Friday.Your venue for shopping will be the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting and in whichproducts from dozens of our subsidiaries will be for sale. (Your Chairman discourages freebies.) Say hello to the many Berkshire managers who will be captaining their exhibits. And be sure to view the terrific BNSF railroad layout thatsalutes all of our companies.Brooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at the meeting.After you purchase a pair, wear them on Sunday at our sixth annual “Berkshire 5K,” an 8 a.m. race starting at theCenturyLink. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor’s Guide that will be sent to you with yourmeeting credentials. Entrants in the race will find themselves running alongside many of Berkshire’s managers,directors and associates. (Charlie and I, however, will sleep in; even with Brooks running shoes, our times would beembarrassing.) Participation in the 5K grows every year. Help us set another record.A GEICO booth in the shopping area will be staffed by a number of the company’s top counselors fromaround the country. At last year’s meeting, we set a record for policy sales, up 43% from 2016.So stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount (usually 8%).This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental point: The discountis not additive if you qualify for another discount, such as that available to certain groups.) Bring the details of yourexisting insurance and check out our price. We can save many of you real money. Spend the savings on other Berkshireproducts.Be sure to visit the Bookworm. This Omaha-based retailer will carry more than 40 books and DVDs, amongthem a couple of new titles. Berkshire shareholders are a bookseller’s dream: When Poor Charlie’s Almanack(yes, ourCharlie) made its debut some years ago, we sold 3,500 copies at the meeting. The book weighed 4.85 pounds. Dothe math: Our shareholders left the building that day carrying about 8
1⁄2tons of Charlie’s wisdom.14An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain thecredential you will need for admission to both the meeting and other events. Keep in mind that most airlinessubstantially increase prices for the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flyingto Kansas City vs. Omaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2
1⁄2hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you significant money. The savings for a couple could run to $1,000 or more. Spend that money with us.At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72
ndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. To obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you must makeyour purchases between Tuesday, May 1
stand Monday, May 7thinclusive, and must also present your meeting credential. Last year, the one-week volume for the store was a staggering $44.6 million. Bricks and mortar are aliveand well at NFM.The period’s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers thatnormally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made anexception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. During “Berkshire Weekend,” NFM will be open from 10 a.m. to9 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday. From 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday, NFM ishosting a picnic to which you are all invited.NFM will again extend its shareholder’s discount offerings to our Kansas City and Dallas stores. From May1
stthrough May 7th, shareholders who present meeting credentials or other evidence of their Berkshire ownership (suchas brokerage statements) to those NFM stores will receive the same discounts enjoyed by those visiting the Omahastore.At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May 4
th. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 6th, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will remain open until 6 p.m. Remember, the more you buy, the more you save (or so my daughtertells me when we visit the store).We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 30
ththrough Saturday, May 12th. During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder either by presenting your meeting credential or a brokerage statement showing youown our stock.On Sunday afternoon, on the upper level above Borsheims, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg,two of the world’s top bridge experts, available to play with our shareholders. If they suggest wagering on the game,change the subject. Ajit, Charlie, Bill Gates and I will likely drop by as well.My friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. I metAriel when she was nine, and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Ariel represented the United Statesin the 2012 Olympics. If you don’t mind embarrassing yourself, test your skills against her, beginning at 1 p.m. BillGates did pretty well playing Ariel last year, so he may be ready to again challenge her. (My advice: Bet on Ariel.) Iwill participate on an advisory basis only.Gorat’s will be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 6
th, serving from 12 p.m. until 10 p.m. To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call 402-551-3733 on April 2
nd(but not before). Show you are a sophisticated diner by ordering the T-bone with hash browns.We will have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the meeting, askingCharlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mailaddresses are: Carol Loomis, the preeminent business journalist of her time, who may be e-mailed atloomisbrk@gmail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of theNew York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.
15From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most interestingand important to shareholders. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if youkeep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than twoquestions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentionedif your question is asked.)An accompanying set of questions will be asked by three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year theinsurance specialist will be Gary Ransom of Dowling & Partners. Questions that deal with our non-insuranceoperations will come from Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Sincewhat we will be conducting is ashareholders’meeting, our hope is that the analysts and journalists will ask questionsthat add to our owners’ understanding and knowledge of their investment.Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be tough,for sure, and that’s the way we like it. Multi-part questions aren’t allowed; we want to give as many questioners aspossible a shot at us. Our goal is for you to leave the meeting knowing more about Berkshire than when you came andfor you to have a good time while in Omaha.All told, we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and for18 from the audience. After the 54
th, all questions come from the audience. Charlie and I have often tackled more than60 by 3:30.The questioners from the audience will be chosen by means of 11 drawings that will take place at 8:15 a.m.on the morning of the annual meeting. Each of the 11 microphones installed in the arena and main overflow room willhost, so to speak, a drawing.While I’m on the subject of our owners’ gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believeall shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and, if possible, shouldalso have adequate time to digest and analyze that information before any trading takes place. That’s why we try toissue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is always held on a Saturday (aday that also eases traffic and parking problems).We do not follow the common practice of talking one-on-one with large institutional investors or analysts,treating them instead as we do all other shareholders. There is no one more important to us than the shareholder oflimited means who trusts us with a substantial portion of his or her savings. As I run the company day-to-day – andas I write this letter – that is the shareholder whose image is in my mind. ************For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-Starswho run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I also believe the mindset of ourmanagers to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most ofour managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business “home runs” means as much to them as theirpaycheck.If managers (or directors) own Berkshire shares – and many do – it’s from open-market purchases theyhave made or because they received shares when they sold their businesses to us. None, however, gets the upside of ownership without risking the downside. Our directors and managers stand in your shoes.We continue to have a wonderful group at headquarters. This team efficiently deals with a multitude ofSEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 32,700-page Federal income tax return, oversees the filing of 3,935state tax returns, responds to countless shareholder and media inquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for thecountry’s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board’s activities, fact-checks this letter – and the list goes on andon.
16They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easyand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year, for example, they dealt withthe 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They alsohandle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and French fries (smotheredin Heinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. In addition, they cheerfully pitch in to help at the annual meeting in whateverway they are needed. They are proud to work for Berkshire, and I am proud of them. ************I’ve saved the best for last. Early in 2018, Berkshire’s board elected Ajit Jain and Greg Abel as directorsof Berkshire and also designated each as Vice Chairman. Ajit is now responsible for insurance operations, and Gregoversees the rest of our businesses. Charlie and I will focus on investments and capital allocation.You and I are lucky to have Ajit and Greg working for us. Each has been with Berkshire for decades, andBerkshire’s blood flows through their veins. The character of each man matches his talents. And that says it all.Come to Omaha – the cradle of capitalism – on May 5
thand meet the Berkshire Bunch. All of us look forward to your visit.February 24, 2018 Warren E. Buffett Chairman of the Board

Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at mar ket rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previously the req uirement. In this table, Berkshire’s results through 1978 have been restated to confor m to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculated u sing the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-taxwhereas the Berkshire numbers areafter-tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results woul d have lagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative r eturn. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.
2BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:Berkshire earned $4.0 billion in 2018 utilizing generally accepted accounting principles (commonly called“GAAP”). The components of that figure are $24.8 billion in operating earnings, a $3.0 billion non-cash loss from animpairment of intangible assets (arising almost entirely from our equity interest in Kraft Heinz), $2.8 billion in realizedcapital gains from the sale of investment securities and a $20.6 billion lossfrom a reduction in the amount of unrealized capital gains that existed in our investment holdings.A new GAAP rule requires us to include that last item in earnings. As I emphasized in the 2017 annual report,neither Berkshire’s Vice Chairman, Charlie Munger, nor I believe that rule to be sensible. Rather, both of us haveconsistently thought that at Berkshire this mark-to-market change would produce what I described as “wild andcapricious swings in our bottom line.”The accuracy of that prediction can be suggested by our quarterly results during 2018. In the first and fourthquarters, we reported GAAPlossesof $1.1 billion and $25.4 billion respectively. In the second and third quarters, wereportedprofitsof $12 billion and $18.5 billion. In complete contrast to these gyrations, the many businesses thatBerkshire owns delivered consistent and satisfactory operating earnings in allquarters. For the year, those earnings exceeded their 2016 high of $17.6 billion by 41%.Wide swings in our quarterly GAAP earnings will inevitably continue. That’s because our huge equityportfolio – valued at nearly $173 billion at the end of 2018 – will often experience one-day price fluctuations of $2billion or more, all of which the new rule says must be dropped immediately to our bottom line. Indeed, in the fourthquarter, a period of high volatility in stock prices, we experienced several days with a “profit” or “loss” of more than$4 billion.Our advice? Focus on operating earnings, paying little attention to gains or losses of any variety. My sayingthat in no way diminishes the importance of our investments to Berkshire. Over time, Charlie and I expect them todeliver substantial gains, albeit with highly irregular timing. ************Long-time readers of our annual reports will have spotted the different way in which I opened this letter. Fornearly three decades, the initial paragraph featured the percentage change in Berkshire’s per-share book value. It’snow time to abandon that practice.The fact is that the annual change in Berkshire’s book value – which makes its farewell appearance on page2 – is a metric that has lost the relevance it once had. Three circumstances have made that so. First, Berkshire hasgradually morphed from a company whose assets are concentrated in marketable stocks into one whose major valueresides in operating businesses. Charlie and I expect that reshaping to continue in an irregular manner. Second, whileourequity holdingsare valued at market prices, accounting rules require our collection of operating companiesto be included in book value at an amount far below their current value, a mismark that has grown in recent years. Third, itis likely that – over time – Berkshire will be a significant repurchaser of its shares, transactions that will take place atprices above book value but below our estimate of intrinsic value. The math of such purchases is simple: Eachtransaction makes per-share intrinsic value go up, while per-share book value goes down. That combination causesthe book-value scorecard to become increasingly out of touch with economic reality.3In future tabulations of our financial results, we expect to focus on Berkshire’s market price. Markets can beextremely capricious: Just look at the 54-year history laid out on page 2. Over time, however, Berkshire’s stock pricewill provide the best measure of business performance. ************Before moving on, I want to give you some good news – reallygood news – that is not reflected in our financial statements. It concerns the management changes we made in early 2018, when Ajit Jain was put in chargeof all insurance activities and Greg Abel was given authority over all other operations. These moves were overdue.Berkshire is now far better managed than when I alone was supervising operations. Ajit and Greg have rare talents,and Berkshire blood flows through their veins.Now let’s take a look at what you own.Focus on the Forest – Forget the TreesInvestors who evaluate Berkshire sometimes obsess on the details of our many and diverse businesses – oureconomic “trees,” so to speak. Analysis of that type can be mind-numbing, given that we own a vast array ofspecimens, ranging from twigs to redwoods. A few of our trees are diseased and unlikely to be around a decade fromnow. Many others, though, are destined to grow in size and beauty.Fortunately, it’s not necessary to evaluate each tree individually to make a rough estimate of Berkshire’sintrinsic business value. That’s because our forest contains five “groves” of major importance, each of which can beappraised, with reasonable accuracy, in its entirety. Four of those groves are differentiated clusters of businesses andfinancial assets that are easy to understand. The fifth – our huge and diverse insurance operation – delivers great valueto Berkshire in a less obvious manner, one I will explain later in this letter.Before we look more closely at the first four groves, let me remind you of our prime goal in the deploymentof your capital: to buy ably-managed businesses, in whole or part, that possess favorable and durable economic characteristics. We also need to make these purchases at sensible prices.Sometimes we can buy control of companies that meet our tests. Far more often, we find the attributes weseek in publicly-traded businesses, in which we normally acquire a 5% to 10% interest. Our two-pronged approach tohuge-scale capital allocation is rare in corporate America and, at times, gives us an important advantage.In recent years, the sensible course for us to follow has been clear: Many stocks have offered far more forour money than we could obtain by purchasing businesses in their entirety. That disparity led us to buy about $43billion of marketable equities last year, while selling only $19 billion. Charlie and I believe the companies in whichwe invested offered excellent value, far exceeding that available in takeover transactions.Despite our recent additions to marketable equities, the most valuable grove in Berkshire’s forest remains themany dozens of non-insurance businesses that Berkshire controls (usually with 100% ownership and never with lessthan 80%). Those subsidiaries earned $16.8 billion last year. When we say “earned,” moreover, we are describing whatremains afterallincome taxes, interest payments, managerial compensation (whether cash or stock-based),restructuring expenses, depreciation, amortization and home-office overhead.That brand of earnings is a far cry from that frequently touted by Wall Street bankers and corporate CEOs.Too often, their presentations feature “adjusted EBITDA,” a measure that redefines “earnings” to exclude a variety ofall-too-real costs.
4For example, managements sometimes assert that their company’s stock-based compensation shouldn’t becounted as an expense. (What else could it be – a giftfrom shareholders?) And restructuring expenses? Well, maybe last year’s exact rearrangement won’t recur. But restructurings of one sort or another are common in business –Berkshire has gone down that road dozens of times, and our shareholders have always borne the costs of doing so.Abraham Lincoln once posed the question: “If you call a dog’s tail a leg, how many legs does it have?” andthen answered his own query: “Four, because calling a tail a leg doesn’t make it one.” Abe would have felt lonely onWall Street.Charlie and I do contend that our acquisition-related amortization expenses of $1.4 billion (detailed on pageK-84) are not a true economic cost. We add back such amortization “costs” to GAAP earnings when we are evaluatingboth private businesses and marketable stocks.In contrast, Berkshire’s $8.4 billion depreciation charge understates our true economic cost. In fact, we needto spendmorethan this sum annually to simply remain competitive in our many operations. Beyond those“maintenance” capital expenditures, we spend large sums in pursuit of growth. Overall, Berkshire invested a record$14.5 billion last year in plant, equipment and other fixed assets, with 89% of that spent in America.Berkshire’s runner-up grove by value is its collection of equities, typically involving a 5% to 10% ownershipposition in a very large company. As noted earlier, our equity investments were worth nearly $173 billion at yearend,an amount far above their cost. If the portfolio had been sold at its yearend valuation, federal income tax of about$14.7 billion would have been payable on the gain. In all likelihood, we will hold most of these stocks for a long time.Eventually, however, gains generate taxes at whatever rate prevails at the time of sale.Our investees paid us dividends of $3.8 billion last year, a sum that will increase in 2019. Far more importantthan the dividends, though, are the huge earnings that are annually retained by these companies. Consider, as anindicator, these figures that cover only our five largest holdings.YearendOwnership

(1) Based on current annual rate.(2) Based on 2018 earnings minus common and preferred dividends paid.GAAP – which dictates the earnings we report – does not allow us to include the retained earnings ofinvestees in our financial accounts. But those earnings are of enormous value to us: Over the years, earnings retainedby our investees (viewed as a group) have eventually delivered capital gains to Berkshire that totaled more than onedollar for each dollar these companies reinvested for us.All of our major holdings enjoy excellent economics, and most use a portion of their retained earnings torepurchase their shares. We very much like that: If Charlie and I think an investee’s stock is underpriced, we rejoicewhen management employs some of its earnings to increase Berkshire’s ownership percentage.
5Here’s one example drawn from the table above: Berkshire’s holdings of American Express have remainedunchanged over the past eight years. Meanwhile, our ownership increased from 12.6% to 17.9% because ofrepurchases made by the company. Last year, Berkshire’s portion of the $6.9 billion earned by American Express was$1.2 billion, about 96% of the $1.3 billion we paid for our stake in the company. When earnings increase and sharesoutstanding decrease, owners – over time – usually do well.A third category of Berkshire’s business ownership is a quartet of companies in which we share control withother parties. Our portion of the after-tax operating earnings of these businesses – 26.7% of Kraft Heinz, 50% ofBerkadia and Electric Transmission Texas, and 38.6% of Pilot Flying J – totaled about $1.3 billion in 2018.In our fourth grove, Berkshire held $112 billion at yearend in U.S. Treasury bills and other cash equivalents,and another $20 billion in miscellaneous fixed-income instruments. We consider a portion of that stash to beuntouchable, having pledged to always hold at least $20 billion in cash equivalents to guard against external calamities.We have also promised to avoidanyactivities that could threaten our maintaining that buffer.Berkshire will forever remain a financial fortress. In managing, I will make expensive mistakes ofcommission and will also miss many opportunities, some of which should have been obvious to me. At times, ourstock will tumble as investors flee from equities. But I will never risk getting caught short of cash.In the years ahead, we hope to move much of our excess liquidity into businesses that Berkshire willpermanently own. The immediate prospects for that, however, are not good: Prices are sky-high for businessespossessing decent long-term prospects.That disappointing reality means that 2019 will likely see us again expanding our holdings of marketableequities. We continue, nevertheless, to hope for an elephant-sized acquisition. Even at our ages of 88 and 95 – I’m the young one– that prospect is what causes my heart and Charlie’s to beat faster. (Just writing about the possibility of ahuge purchase has caused my pulse rate to soar.)My expectation of more stock purchases isnota market call. Charlie and I have no idea as to how stocks will behave next week or next year. Predictions of that sort have neverbeen a part of our activities. Our thinking, rather, is focused on calculating whether a portion of an attractive business is worth more than its market price. ************I believe Berkshire’s intrinsic value can beapproximated by summing the values of our four asset-laden groves and then subtracting an appropriate amount for taxes eventually payable on the sale of marketable securities.You may ask whether an allowance should not also be made for the major tax costs Berkshire would incur ifwe were to sell certain of our wholly-owned businesses. Forget that thought: It would be foolish for us to sell any ofour wonderful companies even ifnotax would be payable on its sale. Truly good businesses are exceptionally hard tofind. Selling any you are lucky enough to own makes no sense at all.The interest cost onallof our debt has been deducted as an expense in calculating the earnings at Berkshire’snon-insurance businesses. Beyond that, much of our ownership of the first four groves is financed by funds generatedfrom Berkshire’s fifth grove – a collection of exceptional insurance companies. We call those funds “float,” a sourceof financing that we expect to be cost-free – or maybe even better than that – over time. We will explain thecharacteristics of float later in this letter.Finally, a point of key and lasting importance: Berkshire’s value is maximized by our having assembled thefive groves into a single entity. This arrangement allows us to seamlessly and objectively allocate major amounts ofcapital, eliminate enterprise risk, avoid insularity, fund assets at exceptionally low cost, occasionally take advantageof tax efficiencies, and minimize overhead.At Berkshire, the whole is greater – considerably greater – than the sum of the parts.6Repurchases and ReportingEarlier I mentioned that Berkshire will from time to time be repurchasing its own stock. Assuming that webuy at a discount to Berkshire’s intrinsic value – which certainly will be our intention – repurchases will benefit boththose shareholders leaving the company and those who stay.True, the upside from repurchases is very slight for those who are leaving. That’s because careful buying byus will minimize any impact on Berkshire’s stock price. Nevertheless, there is somebenefit to sellers in having an extra buyer in the market.For continuing shareholders, the advantage is obvious: If the market prices a departing partner’s interest at,say, 90¢ on the dollar, continuing shareholders reap an increase in per-share intrinsic value with every repurchase bythe company. Obviously, repurchases should be price-sensitive: Blindly buying an overpriced stock is value-destructive, a fact lost on many promotional or ever-optimistic CEOs.When a company says that it contemplates repurchases, it’s vital that all shareholder-partners be given theinformation they need to make an intelligent estimate of value. Providing that information is what Charlie and I try todo in this report. We do not want a partner to sell shares back to the company because he or she has been misled orinadequately informed.Some sellers, however, may disagree with our calculation of value and others may have found investmentsthat they consider more attractive than Berkshire shares. Some of that second group will be right: There areunquestionably many stocks that will deliver far greater gains than ours.In addition, certain shareholders will simply decide it’s time for them or their families to become netconsumers rather than continuing to build capital. Charlie and I have no current interest in joining that group. Perhapswe will become big spenders in our old age. ************For 54 years our managerial decisions at Berkshire have been made from the viewpoint of the shareholderswho are staying, not those who are leaving. Consequently, Charlie and I have neverfocused on current-quarter results. Berkshire, in fact, may be the only company in the Fortune 500 that does not prepare monthly earnings reportsor balance sheets. I, of course, regularly view the monthly financial reports of most subsidiaries. But Charlie and Ilearn of Berkshire’s overall earnings and financial position only on a quarterly basis.Furthermore, Berkshire has no company-wide budget (though many of our subsidiaries find one useful). Ourlack of such an instrument means that the parent company has neverhad a quarterly “number” to hit. Shunning the use of this bogey sends an important message to our many managers, reinforcing the culture we prize.Over the years, Charlie and I have seen all sorts of bad corporate behavior, both accounting and operational,induced by the desire of management to meet Wall Street expectations. What starts as an “innocent” fudge in order tonot disappoint “the Street” – say, trade-loading at quarter-end, turning a blind eye to rising insurance losses, or drawingdown a “cookie-jar” reserve – can become the first step toward full-fledged fraud. Playing with the numbers “just thisonce” may well be the CEO’s intent; it’s seldom the end result. And if it’s okay for the boss to cheat a little, it’s easyfor subordinates to rationalize similar behavior.At Berkshire, our audience is neither analysts nor commentators: Charlie and I are working for ourshareholder-partners. The numbers that flow up to us will be the ones we send on to you.
7Non-Insurance Operations – From Lollipops to LocomotivesLet’s now look further at Berkshire’s most valuable grove – our collection of non-insurance businesses –keeping in mind that we do not wish to unnecessarily hand our competitors information that might be useful to them.Additional details about individual operations can be found on pages K-5 – K-22 and pages K-40 – K-51.Viewed as a group, these businesses earned pre-tax income in 2018 of $20.8 billion, a 24% increase over2017. Acquisitions we made in 2018 delivered only a trivial amount of that gain.I will stick with pre-tax figures in this discussion. But our after-tax gain in 2018 from these businesses wasfargreater – 47%– thanks in large part to the cut in the corporate tax rate that became effective at the beginning ofthat year. Let’s look at why the impact was so dramatic.Begin with an economic reality: Like it or not, the U.S. Government “owns” an interest in Berkshire’searnings of a size determined by Congress. In effect, our country’s Treasury Department holds a special class of ourstock – call this holding the AA shares – that receives large “dividends” (that is, tax payments) from Berkshire. In2017, as in many years before, the corporate tax rate was 35%, which meant that the Treasury was doing very wellwith its AA shares. Indeed, the Treasury’s “stock,” which was paying nothing when we took over in 1965, had evolvedinto a holding that delivered billions of dollars annually to the federal government.Last year, however, 40% of the government’s “ownership” (14/35
ths) was returned to Berkshire – free of charge – when the corporate tax rate was reduced to 21%. Consequently, our “A” and “B” shareholders received amajor boost in the earnings attributable totheirshares.This happening materially increased the intrinsic value of the Berkshire shares you and I own. The samedynamic, moreover, enhanced the intrinsic value of almost all of the stocks Berkshire holds.Those are the headlines. But there are other factors to consider that tempered our gain. For example, the taxbenefits garnered by our large utility operation get passed along to its customers. Meanwhile, the tax rate applicableto the substantial dividends we receive from domestic corporations is little changed at about 13%. (This lower rate haslong been logical because our investees have already paid tax on the earnings that they pay to us.) Overall, however,the new law made our businesses and the stocks we own considerablymore valuable. Which suggests that we return to the performance of our non-insurance businesses. Our two towering redwoodsin this grove are BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (90.9% owned). Combined, they earned $9.3 billion before taxlast year, up 6% from 2017. You can read more about these businesses on pages K-5 – K-10 and pages K-40 – K-45.Our next five non-insurance subsidiaries, as ranked by earnings (but presented here alphabetically), ClaytonHomes, International Metalworking, Lubrizol, Marmon and Precision Castparts, had aggregate pre-tax income in 2018of $6.4 billion, up from the $5.5 billion these companies earned in 2017.The next five, similarly ranked and listed (Forest River, Johns Manville, MiTek, Shaw and TTI) earned $2.4billion pre-tax last year, up from $2.1 billion in 2017.The remaining non-insurance businesses that Berkshire owns – and there are many – had pre-tax income of$3.6 billion in 2018 vs. $3.3 billion in 2017.
8Insurance, “Float,” and the Funding of BerkshireOur property/casualty (“P/C”) insurance business – our fifth grove – has been the engine propellingBerkshire’s growth since 1967, the year we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire &Marine, for $8.6 million. Today, National Indemnity is the largest property/casualty company in the world as measuredby net worth.One reason we were attracted to the P/C business was the industry’s business model: P/C insurers receivepremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos, or severeworkplace accidents, payments can stretch over many decades.This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums – money we call “float” – thatwill eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their own benefit. Though individualpolicies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation topremium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And howit has grown, as the following table shows:Year
Float (in millions)*
1970 $ 391980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322018 122,732*Includes float arising from life, annuity and health insurance businesses . We may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline will be verygradual – at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can neverbe subject to immediate or near- term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. That structure is by design and is a keycomponent in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. That strength will neverbe compromised. If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers anunderwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy theuse of free money – and, better yet, getpaidfor holding it.Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorousindeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. That loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insurance industry,despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning subnormal returns ontangible net worth as compared to other American businesses.Nevertheless, I like our own prospects. Berkshire’s unrivaled financial strength allows us far more flexibilityin investing our float than that generally available to P/C companies. The many alternatives available to us are alwaysan advantage and occasionally offer major opportunities. When other insurers are constrained, our choices expand.Moreover, our P/C companies have an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at anunderwriting profit for 15 of the past 16 years, the exception being 2017, when our pre-tax loss was $3.2 billion. Forthe entire 16-year span, our pre-tax gain totaled $27 billion, of which $2 billion was recorded in 2018.
9That record is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of our insurance managers, whoknow that the benefits of float can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service.At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style. ************In most cases, the funding of a business comes from two sources – debt and equity. At Berkshire, we havetwo additional arrows in the quiver to talk about, but let’s first address the conventional components.We use debt sparingly. Many managers, it should be noted, will disagree with this policy, arguing thatsignificant debt juices the returns for equity owners. And these more venturesome CEOs will be right mostof the time. At rare and unpredictable intervals, however, credit vanishes and debt becomes financially fatal. A Russian-roulette equation – usually win, occasionally die – may make financial sense for someone who gets a piece of acompany’s upside but does not share in its downside. But that strategy would be madness for Berkshire. Rationalpeople don’t risk what they have and need for what they don’t have and don’t need.Most of the debt you see on our consolidated balance sheet – see page K-65 – resides at our railroad andenergy subsidiaries, both of them asset-heavy companies. During recessions, the cash generation of these businessesremains bountiful. The debt they use is both appropriate for their operations and notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our level of equity capital is a different story: Berkshire’s $349 billion is unmatched in corporate America. Byretaining all earnings for a very long time, and allowing compound interest to work its magic, we have amassed fundsthat have enabled us to purchase and develop the valuable groves earlier described. Had we instead followed a 100%payout policy, we would still be working with the $22 millionwith which we began fiscal 1965. Beyond using debt and equity, Berkshire has benefitted in a major way from two less-common sources ofcorporate funding. The larger is the float I have described. So far, those funds, though they are recorded as a huge netliabilityon our balance sheet, have been of more utility to us than an equivalent amount of equity. That’s because theyhave usually been accompanied by underwriting earnings. In effect, we have been paidin most years for holding and using other people’s money.As I have often done before, I will emphasize that this happy outcome is far from a sure thing: Mistakes inassessing insurance risks can be huge and can take many years to surface. (Think asbestos.) A major catastrophe thatwill dwarf hurricanes Katrina and Michaelwilloccur – perhaps tomorrow, perhaps many decades from now. “The Big One” may come from a traditional source, such as a hurricane or earthquake, or it may be a total surprise involving,say, a cyber attack having disastrous consequences beyond anything insurers now contemplate. When such a mega-catastrophe strikes, we will get our share of the losses and they will be big – verybig. Unlike many other insurers, however, we will be looking to add business the next day.The final funding source – which again Berkshire possesses to an unusual degree – is deferred income taxes.These are liabilities that we will eventually pay but that are meanwhile interest-free.As I indicated earlier, about $14.7 billion of our $50.5 billion of deferred taxes arises from the unrealizedgains in our equity holdings. These liabilities are accrued in our financial statements at the current 21% corporate taxrate but will be paid at the rates prevailing when our investments are sold. Between now and then, we in effect havean interest-free “loan” that allows us to have more money working for us in equities than would otherwise be the case.
10A further $28.3 billion of deferred tax results from our being able to accelerate the depreciation of assets suchas plant and equipment in calculating the tax we must currently pay. The front-ended savings in taxes that we recordgradually reverse in future years. We regularly purchase additional assets, however. As long as the present tax lawprevails, this source of funding should trend upward.Over time, Berkshire’s funding base – that’s the right-hand side of our balance sheet – should grow, primarilythrough the earnings we retain. Our job is to put the money retained to good use on the left-hand side, by addingattractive assets.GEICO and Tony NicelyThat title says it all: The company and the man are inseparable.Tony joined GEICO in 1961 at the age of 18; I met him in the mid-1970s. At that time, GEICO, after a four-decade record of both rapid growth and outstanding underwriting results, suddenly found itself near bankruptcy. Arecently-installed management had grossly underestimated GEICO’s loss costs and consequently underpriced itsproduct. It would take many months until those loss-generating policies on GEICO’s books – there were no less than2.3 million of them – would expire and could then be repriced. The company’s net worth in the meantime was rapidlyapproaching zero.In 1976, Jack Byrne was brought in as CEO to rescue GEICO. Soon after his arrival, I met him, concludedthat he was the perfect man for the job, and began to aggressively buy GEICO shares. Within a few months, Berkshirebought about
1⁄3of the company, a portion that later grew to roughly1⁄2without our spending a dime. That stunning accretion occurred because GEICO, after recovering its health, consistently repurchased its shares. All told, this half-interest in GEICO cost Berkshire $47 million, about what you might pay today for a trophy apartment in New York.Let’s now fast-forward 17 years to 1993, when Tony Nicely was promoted to CEO. At that point, GEICO’sreputation and profitability had been restored – but not its growth. Indeed, at yearend 1992 the company had only 1.9million auto policies on its books, far less than its pre-crisis high. In sales volume among U.S. auto insurers, GEICOthen ranked an undistinguished seventh.Late in 1995, after Tony had re-energized GEICO, Berkshire made an offer to buy the remaining 50% of thecompany for $2.3 billion, about 50 times what we had paid for the first half (and people say I never pay up!). Ouroffer was successful and brought Berkshire a wonderful, but underdeveloped, company and an equally wonderfulCEO, who would move GEICO forward beyond my dreams.GEICO is now America’s Number Two auto insurer, with sales 1,200% greater than it recorded in 1995.Underwriting profits have totaled $15.5 billion (pre-tax) since our purchase, and float available for investment hasgrown from $2.5 billion to $22.1 billion.By my estimate, Tony’s management of GEICO has increased Berkshire’s intrinsic value by more than $50billion. On top of that, he is a model for everything a manager should be, helping his 40,000 associates to identify andpolish abilities they didn’t realize they possessed.Last year, Tony decided to retire as CEO, and on June 30
thhe turned that position over to Bill Roberts, his long-time partner. I’ve known and watched Bill operate for several decades, and once again Tony made the rightmove. Tony remains Chairman and will be helpful to GEICO for the rest of his life. He’s incapable of doing less.AllBerkshire shareholders owe Tony their thanks.Ihead the list.
11InvestmentsBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value. We excludeour Kraft Heinz holding – 325,442,152 shares – because Berkshire is part of a control group and therefore mustaccount for this investment on the “equity” method. On its balance sheet, Berkshire carries its Kraft Heinz holding ata GAAP figure of $13.8 billion, an amount reduced by our share of the large write-off of intangible assets taken byKraft Heinz in 2018. At yearend, our Kraft Heinz holding had a market value of $14 billion and a cost basis of$9.8 billion. 12/31/18

* Excludes shares held by pension funds of Berkshire subsidiaries.** This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis.Charlie and I donotview the $172.8 billion detailed above as a collection of ticker symbols – a financialdalliance to be terminated because of downgrades by “the Street,” expected Federal Reserve actions, possible politicaldevelopments, forecasts by economists or whatever else might be the subject du jour. What we see in our holdings, rather, is an assembly of companies that we partly own and that, on a weightedbasis, are earning about20%on the net tangible equity capital required to run their businesses. These companies, also,earn their profits without employing excessive levels of debt.
12Returns of that order by large, established and understandable businesses are remarkable under anycircumstances. They are truly mind-blowing when compared against the return that many investors have accepted onbonds over the last decade – 3% or less on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, for example.On occasion, a ridiculously-high purchase price for a given stock will cause a splendid business to become apoor investment – if not permanently, at least for a painfully long period. Over time, however, investment performanceconverges with business performance. And, as I will next spell out, the record of American business has beenextraordinary.The American TailwindOn March 11
th, it will be 77 years since I first invested in an American business. The year was 1942, I was11, and I went all in, investing $114.75 I had begun accumulating at age six. What I bought was three shares of CitiesService preferred stock. I had become a capitalist, and it felt good.Let’s now travel back through the two 77-year periods that preceded my purchase. That leaves us starting in1788, a year prior to George Washington’s installation as our first president. Could anyone then have imagined whattheir new country would accomplish in only three 77-year lifetimes?During the two 77-year periods prior to 1942, the United States had grown from four million people – about
1⁄2of 1% of the world’s population – into the most powerful country on earth. In that spring of 1942, though, it faceda crisis: The U.S. and its allies were suffering heavy losses in a war that we had entered only three months earlier. Badnews arrived daily.Despite the alarming headlines, almost all Americans believed on that March 11
ththat the war would be won. Nor was their optimism limited to that victory. Leaving aside congenital pessimists, Americans believed thattheir children and generations beyond would live far better lives than they themselves had led.The nation’s citizens understood, of course, that the road ahead would not be a smooth ride. It never hadbeen. Early in its history our country was tested by a Civil War that killed 4% of all American males and led PresidentLincoln to openly ponder whether “a nation so conceived and so dedicated could long endure.” In the 1930s, Americasuffered through the Great Depression, a punishing period of massive unemployment.Nevertheless, in 1942, when I made my purchase, the nation expected post-war growth, a belief that provedto be well-founded. In fact, the nation’s achievements can best be described as breathtaking.Let’s put numbers to that claim: If my $114.75 had been invested in a no-fee S&P 500 index fund, and alldividends had been reinvested, my stake would have grown to be worth (pre-taxes) $606,811 on January 31, 2019 (thelatest data available before the printing of this letter). That is a gain of 5,288 for 1.Meanwhile, a $1 million investment by a tax-free institution of that time – say, a pension fund or college endowment – would have grown to about $5.3billion.Let me add one additional calculation that I believe will shock you: If that hypothetical institution had paidonly1%of assets annually to various “helpers,” such as investment managers and consultants, its gain would havebeencut in half, to $2.65 billion. That’s what happens over 77 years when the 11.8% annual return actually achievedby the S&P 500 is recalculated at a 10.8% rate.
13Those who regularly preach doom because of government budget deficits (as I regularly did myself for manyyears) might note that our country’s national debt has increased roughly 400-fold during the last of my 77-year periods.That’s 40,000%! Suppose you had foreseen this increase and panicked at the prospect of runaway deficits and aworthless currency. To “protect” yourself, you might have eschewed stocks and opted instead to buy 3
1⁄4ounces of gold with your $114.75.And what would that supposed protection have delivered? You would now have an asset worth about $4,200,less than 1% of whatwould have been realized from a simple unmanaged investment in American business. Themagical metal was no match for the American mettle.Our country’s almost unbelievable prosperity has been gained in a bipartisan manner. Since 1942, we havehad seven Republican presidents and seven Democrats. In the years they served, the country contended at various timeswith a long period of viral inflation, a 21% prime rate, several controversial and costly wars, the resignation of apresident, a pervasive collapse in home values, a paralyzing financial panic and a host of other problems. Allengendered scary headlines; all are now history.Christopher Wren, architect of St. Paul’s Cathedral, lies buried within that London church. Near his tomb areposted these words of description (translated from Latin): “If you would seek my monument, look around you.” Thoseskeptical of America’s economic playbook should heed his message.In 1788 – to go back to our starting point – there really wasn’t much here exceptfor a small band of ambitious people and an embryonic governing framework aimed at turning their dreams into reality. Today, the Federal Reserveestimates our household wealth at $108trillion, an amount almost impossible to comprehend.Remember, earlier in this letter, how I described retained earnings as having been the key to Berkshire’sprosperity? So it has been with America. In the nation’s accounting, the comparable item is labeled “savings.” Andsave we have. If our forefathers had instead consumed all they produced, there would have been no investment, noproductivity gains and no leap in living standards. ************Charlie and I happily acknowledge that much of Berkshire’s success has simply been a product of what Ithink should be calledThe American Tailwind. It is beyond arrogance for American businesses or individuals to boastthat they have “done it alone.” The tidy rows of simple white crosses at Normandy should shame those who makesuch claims.There are also many other countries around the world that have bright futures. About that, we should rejoice:Americans will be both more prosperous and safer if allnations thrive. At Berkshire, we hope to invest significant sums across borders.Over the next 77 years, however, the major source of our gains will almost certainly be provided by TheAmerican Tailwind. We are lucky – gloriously lucky – to have that force at our back.

2BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:Berkshire earned $81.4 billion in 2019 according to generally accepted accounting principles (commonlycalled “GAAP”). The components of that figure are $24 billion of operating earnings, $3.7 billion of realized capitalgains and a $53.7 billion gain from an increase in the amount of net unrealizedcapital gains that exist in the stocks we hold. Each of those components of earnings is stated on an after-tax basis.That $53.7 billion gain requires comment. It resulted from a new GAAP rule, imposed in 2018, that requiresa company holding equity securities to include in earnings the net change in the unrealizedgains and losses of those securities. As we stated in last year’s letter, neither Charlie Munger, my partner in managing Berkshire, nor I agreewith that rule.The adoption of the rule by the accounting profession, in fact, was a monumental shift in its own thinking.Before 2018, GAAP insisted – with an exception for companies whose business was to trade securities – thatunrealizedgainswithin a portfolio of stocks wereneverto be included in earnings and unrealizedlosseswere to be includedonlyif they were deemed “other than temporary.” Now, Berkshire must enshrine in each quarter’s bottomline – a key item of news for many investors, analysts and commentators – every up and down movement of the stocksit owns, however capricious those fluctuations may be.Berkshire’s 2018 and 2019 years glaringly illustrate the argument we have with the new rule. In 2018, a downyear for the stock market, our net unrealized gains decreasedby $20.6 billion, and we therefore reported GAAP earnings of only $4 billion. In 2019,risingstock prices increased net unrealized gains by the aforementioned $53.7billion, pushing GAAP earnings to the $81.4 billion reported at the beginning of this letter. Those market gyrationsled to a crazy 1,900% increase in GAAP earnings!Meanwhile, in what we might call the real world, as opposed to accounting-land, Berkshire’s equity holdingsaveraged about $200 billion during the two years, and the intrinsic valueof the stocks we own grew steadily and substantially throughout the period.Charlie and I urge you to focus on operating earnings – which were little changed in 2019 – and to ignoreboth quarterly and annual gains or losses from investments, whether these are realized or unrealized.Our advising thatin no waydiminishes the importance of these investments to Berkshire. Over time, Charlieand I expect our equity holdings – as a group – to deliver majorgains, albeit in an unpredictable and highly irregular manner. To see why we are optimistic, move on to the next discussion.The Power of Retained EarningsIn 1924, Edgar Lawrence Smith, an obscure economist and financial advisor, wrote Common Stocks as Long Term Investments, a slim book that changed the investment world. Indeed, writing the book changed Smith himself,forcing him to reassess his own investment beliefs.Going in, he planned to argue that stocks would perform better than bonds during inflationary periods andthat bonds would deliver superior returns during deflationary times. That seemed sensible enough. But Smith was infor a shock.3His book began, therefore, with a confession: “These studies are the record of a failure – the failure of factsto sustain a preconceived theory.” Luckily for investors, that failure led Smith to think more deeply about how stocksshould be evaluated.For the crux of Smith’s insight, I will quote an early reviewer of his book, none other than John MaynardKeynes: “I have kept until last what is perhaps Mr. Smith’s most important, and is certainly his most novel, point.Well-managed industrial companies do not, as a rule, distribute to the shareholders the whole of their earned profits.In good years, if not in all years, they retain a part of their profits and put them back into the business. Thus there is an element of compound interest(Keynes’ italics) operating in favour of a sound industrial investment. Over a periodof years, the real value of the property of a sound industrial is increasing at compound interest, quite apart from thedividends paid out to the shareholders.”And with that sprinkling of holy water, Smith was no longer obscure.It’s difficult to understand why retained earnings were unappreciated by investors before Smith’s book waspublished. After all, it was no secret that mind-boggling wealth had earlier been amassed by such titans as Carnegie,Rockefeller and Ford, all of whom had retained a huge portion of their business earnings to fund growth and produceever-greater profits. Throughout America, also, there had long been small-time capitalists who became rich followingthe same playbook.Nevertheless, when business ownership was sliced into small pieces – “stocks” – buyers in the pre-Smithyears usually thought of their shares as a short-term gamble on market movements. Even at their best, stocks wereconsidered speculations.Gentlemenpreferred bonds.Though investors were slow to wise up, the math of retaining and reinvesting earnings is now wellunderstood. Today, school children learn what Keynes termed “novel”: combining savings with compound interestworks wonders. ************At Berkshire, Charlie and I have long focused on using retained earnings advantageously. Sometimes thisjob has been easy – at other times, more than difficult, particularly when we began working with huge and ever-growing sums of money.In our deployment of the funds we retain, we first seek to invest in the many and diverse businesses wealready own. During the past decade, Berkshire’s depreciation charges have aggregated $65 billion whereas thecompany’sinternalinvestments in property, plant and equipment have totaled $121 billion. Reinvestment inproductive operational assets will forever remain our top priority.In addition, we constantly seek to buy new businesses that meet three criteria. First, they must earn goodreturns on the net tangible capital required in their operation. Second, they must be run by able and honest managers.Finally, they must be available at a sensible price.When we spot such businesses, our preference would be to buy 100% of them. But the opportunities to makemajor acquisitions possessing our required attributes are rare. Far more often, a fickle stock market serves upopportunities for us to buy large,but non-controlling, positions in publicly-traded companies that meet our standards.Whichever way we go – controlled companies or only a major stake by way of the stock market – Berkshire’sfinancial results from the commitment will in large part be determined by the future earnings of the business we havepurchased. Nonetheless, there is between the two investment approaches a hugely important accounting difference,essential for you to understand.
4In our controlled companies, (defined as those in which Berkshire owns more than 50% of the shares), theearnings of each business flow directly into the operating earnings that we report to you. What you see is what youget.In the non-controlled companies, in which we own marketable stocks, onlythe dividends that Berkshire receives are recorded in the operating earnings we report. The retained earnings? They’re working hard and creatingmuch added value, butnotin a way that deposits those gains directly into Berkshire’s reported earnings.At almost all major companies other than Berkshire, investors would notfind what we’ll call this “non- recognition of earnings” important. For us, however, it is a standout omission, of a magnitude that we lay out for youbelow.Here, we list our 10 largest stock-market holdings of businesses. The list distinguishes between their earningsthat are reported to you under GAAP accounting – these are the dividends Berkshire receives from those 10 investees– and our share, so to speak, of the earnings the investees retain and put to work. Normally, those companies useretained earnings to expand their business and increase its efficiency. Or sometimes they use those funds to repurchasesignificant portions of their own stock, an act that enlarges Berkshire’s share of the company’s future earnings.YearendOwnership

(1) Based on current annual rate.(2) Based on 2019 earnings minus common and preferred dividends paid.Obviously, the realized gains we will eventually record from partially owning each of these companies willnot neatly correspond to “our” share of their retained earnings. Sometimes, alas, retentions produce nothing. But bothlogic and our past experience indicate that from the groupwe will realize capital gains at least equal to – and probably better than – the earnings of ours that they retained. (When we sell shares and realize gains, we will pay income tax onthe gain at whatever rate then prevails. Currently, the federal rate is 21%.)It is certain that Berkshire’s rewards from these 10 companies, as well as those from our many other equityholdings, will manifest themselves in a highly irregular manner. Periodically, there will be losses, sometimescompany-specific, sometimes linked to stock-market swoons. At other times – last year was one of those – our gainwill be outsized. Overall, the retained earnings of our investees are certain to be of majorimportance in the growth of Berkshire’s value.Mr. Smith got it right.
5Non-Insurance OperationsTom Murphy, a valued director of Berkshire and an all-time great among business managers, long ago gaveme some important advice about acquisitions: “To achieve a reputation as a good manager, just be sure you buy goodbusinesses.”Over the years Berkshire has acquired many dozens of companies, all of which I initially regarded as “goodbusinesses.” Some, however, proved disappointing; more than a few were outright disasters. A reasonable number, onthe other hand, have exceeded my hopes.In reviewing my uneven record, I’ve concluded that acquisitions are similar to marriage: They start, of course,with a joyful wedding – but then reality tends to diverge from pre-nuptial expectations. Sometimes, wonderfully, thenew union delivers bliss beyond either party’s hopes. In other cases, disillusionment is swift. Applying those imagesto corporate acquisitions, I’d have to say it is usually the buyer who encounters unpleasant surprises. It’s easy to getdreamy-eyed during corporate courtships.Pursuing that analogy, I would say that our marital record remains largely acceptable, with all parties happywith the decisions they made long ago. Some of our tie-ups have been positively idyllic. A meaningful number,however, have caused me all too quickly to wonder what I was thinking when I proposed.Fortunately, the fallout from many of my errors has been reduced by a characteristic shared by mostbusinesses that disappoint: As the years pass, the “poor” business tends to stagnate, thereupon entering a state in whichits operations require an ever-smallerpercentageof Berkshire’s capital. Meanwhile, our “good” businesses often tend to grow and find opportunities for investing additional capital at attractive rates. Because of these contrastingtrajectories, the assets employed at Berkshire’s winners gradually become an expanding portion of our total capital.As an extreme example of those financial movements, witness Berkshire’s original textile business. Whenwe acquired control of the company in early 1965, this beleaguered operation required nearly allof Berkshire’s capital. For some time, therefore, Berkshire’s non-earning textile assets were a huge drag on our overall returns. Eventually,though, we acquired a spread of “good” businesses, a shift that by the early 1980s caused the dwindling textileoperation to employ only a tiny portion of our capital.Today, we have most of your money deployed in controlled businesses that achieve good-to-excellent returnson the net tangible assets each requires for its operations. Our insurance business has been the superstar. That operationhas special characteristics that give it a unique metric for calibrating success, one unfamiliar to many investors. Wewill save that discussion for the next section.In the paragraphs that follow, we group our wide array of non-insurance businesses by size of earnings, after interest, depreciation, taxes, non-cash compensation, restructuring charges – all of those pesky, but very real, coststhat CEOs and Wall Street sometimes urge investors to ignore. Additional information about these operations can befound on pages K-6 – K-21 and pages K-40 – K-52.Our BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) – the two lead dogs of Berkshire’s non-insurance group – earned a combined $8.3 billion in 2019 (including only our 91% share of BHE), an increase of 6%from 2018.Our next five non-insurance subsidiaries, as ranked by earnings (but presented here alphabetically), ClaytonHomes, International Metalworking, Lubrizol, Marmon and Precision Castparts, had aggregate earnings in 2019 of$4.8 billion, little changed from what these companies earned in 2018.The next five, similarly ranked and listed (Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Johns Manville, NetJets, Shawand TTI) earned $1.9 billion last year, up from the $1.7 billion earned by this tier in 2018.
6The remaining non-insurance businesses that Berkshire owns – and there are many – had aggregate earningsof $2.7 billion in 2019, down from $2.8 billion in 2018.Our total net income in 2019 from the non-insurance businesses we control amounted to $17.7 billion, anincrease of 3% from the $17.2 billion this group earned in 2018. Acquisitions and dispositions had almost no net effecton these results. ************I must add one final item that underscores the wide scope of Berkshire’s operations. Since 2011, we haveowned Lubrizol, an Ohio-based company that produces and markets oil additives throughout the world. On September26, 2019, a fire originating at a small next-door operation spread to a large French plant owned by Lubrizol.The result was significant property damage and a major disruption in Lubrizol’s business. Even so, both thecompany’s property loss and business-interruption loss will be mitigated by substantial insurance recoveries thatLubrizol will receive.But, as the late Paul Harvey was given to saying in his famed radio broadcasts, “Here’s the rest of the story.”One of the largest insurers of Lubrizol was a company owned b y...u h ,Berkshire. In Matthew 6:3, the Bible instructs us to “Let not the left hand know what the right hand doeth.” Yourchairman has clearly behaved as ordered.Property/Casualty InsuranceOur property/casualty (“P/C”) insurance business has been the engine propelling Berkshire’s growth since1967, the year we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire & Marine, for $8.6 million.Today, National Indemnity is the largest P/C company in the world as measured by net worth. Insurance is a businessof promises, and Berkshire’s ability to honor its commitments is unmatched.One reason we were attracted to the P/C business was the industry’s business model: P/C insurers receivepremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos, or severeworkplace accidents, payments can stretch over many decades.This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums – money we call “float” – thatwill eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their own benefit. Though individualpolicies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation topremium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And howit has grown, as the following table shows:Year
Float (in millions)
1970 $ 391980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322018 122,7322019 129,423We may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline will be verygradual – at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can neverbe subject to immediate or near- term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. That structure is by design and is a keycomponent in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. That strength will neverbe compromised.7If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers anunderwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy theuse of free money – and, better yet, getpaidfor holding it.For the P/C industry as a whole, the financial value of float is now far less than it was for many years. That’sbecause the standard investment strategy for almost all P/C companies is heavily – and properly– skewed toward high-grade bonds. Changes in interest rates therefore matter enormously to these companies, and during the last decadethe bond market has offered pathetically low rates.Consequently, insurers suffered, as year by year they were forced – by maturities or issuer-call provisions –to recycle their “old” investment portfolios into new holdings providing much lower yields. Where once these insurerscould safely earn 5 cents or 6 cents on each dollar of float, they now take in only 2 cents or 3 cents (or even less iftheir operations are concentrated in countries mired in the never-never land of negative rates).Some insurers may try to mitigate their loss of revenue by buying lower-quality bonds or non-liquid“alternative” investments promising higher yields. But those are dangerous games and activities that most institutionsare ill-equipped to play.Berkshire’s situation is more favorable than that of insurers in general. Most important, our unrivaledmountain of capital, abundance of cash and a huge and diverse stream of non-insurance earnings allow us far moreinvestment flexibility than is generally available to other companies in the industry. The many choices open to us arealways advantageous – and sometimes have presented us with major opportunities.Our P/C companies have meanwhile had an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at anunderwriting profit for 16 of the last 17 years, the exception being 2017, when our pre-tax loss was a whopping $3.2billion. For the entire 17-year span, our pre-tax gain totaled $27.5 billion, of which $400 million was recorded in 2019.That record is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of our insurance managers, whoknow that the rewards of float can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service.At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.As I have repeatedly done in the past, I will emphasize now that happy outcomes in insurance are far from asure thing: We will most certainly not have an underwriting profit in 16 of the next 17 years. Danger always lurks.Mistakes in assessing insurance risks can be huge and can take many years – even decades – to surface andripen. (Think asbestos.) A major catastrophe that will dwarf hurricanes Katrina and Michael willoccur – perhaps tomorrow, perhaps many decades from now. “The Big One” may come from a traditional source, such as wind orearthquake, or it may be a total surprise involving, say, a cyber attack having disastrous consequences beyond anythinginsurers now contemplate. When such a mega-catastrophe strikes, Berkshire will get its share of the losses and theywill be big –verybig. Unlike many other insurers, however, handling the loss will not come close to straining ourresources, and we will be eager toaddto our business the next day.** **********Close your eyes for a moment and try to envision a locale that might spawn a dynamic P/C insurer. NewYork? London? Silicon Valley?How about Wilkes-Barre?
8Late in 2012, Ajit Jain, the invaluable manager of our insurance operations, called to tell me that he wasbuying a tiny company – GUARD Insurance Group – in that small Pennsylvania city for $221 million (roughly its networth at the time). He added that Sy Foguel, GUARD’s CEO, was going to be a star at Berkshire. Both GUARD andSy were new names to me.Bingo and bingo: In 2019, GUARD had premium volume of $1.9 billion, up 379% since 2012, and alsodelivered a satisfactory underwriting profit. Since joining Berkshire, Sy has led the company into both new productsand new regions of the country and has increased GUARD’s float by 265%.In 1967, Omaha seemed an unlikely launching pad for a P/C giant. Wilkes-Barre may well deliver a similarsurprise.Berkshire Hathaway EnergyBerkshire Hathaway Energy is now celebrating its 20
thyear under our ownership. That anniversary suggests that we should be catching up with the company’s accomplishments.We’ll start with the topic of electricity rates. When Berkshire entered the utility business in 2000, purchasing76% of BHE, the company’s residential customers in Iowa paid an average of 8.8 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh).Prices for residential customers have since risen less than 1% a year, and we have promised that there will be no baserate price increases through 2028. In contrast, here’s what is happening at the other large investor-owned Iowa utility:Last year, the rates it charged its residential customers were 61% higher than BHE’s. Recently, that utility received arate increase that will widen the gap to 70%.The extraordinary differential between our rates and theirs is largely the result of our huge accomplishmentsin converting wind into electricity. In 2021, we expect BHE’s operation to generate about 25.2 million megawatt-hoursof electricity (MWh) in Iowa from wind turbines that it both owns and operates. That output will totally cover theannual needs of its Iowa customers, which run to about 24.6 million MWh. In other words, our utility will have attainedwind self-sufficiency in the state of Iowa.In still another contrast, that other Iowa utility generates less than 10% of its power from wind. Furthermore,we know of no other investor-owned utility, wherever located, that by 2021 will have achieved a position of windself-sufficiency. In 2000, BHE was serving an agricultural-based economy; today, three of its five largest customersare high-tech giants. I believe their decisions to site plants in Iowa were in part based upon BHE’s ability to deliverrenewable, low-cost energy.Of course, wind is intermittent, and our blades in Iowa turn only part of the time. In certain periods, whenthe air is still, we look to our non-wind generating capacity to secure the electricity we need. At opposite times, wesell the excess power that wind provides us to other utilities, serving them through what’s called “the grid.” The powerwe sell them supplants their need for a carbon resource – coal, say, or natural gas.Berkshire Hathaway now owns 91% of BHE in partnership with Walter Scott, Jr. and Greg Abel. BHE hasnever paid Berkshire Hathaway a dividend since our purchase and has, as the years have passed, retained $28 billionof earnings. That pattern is an outlier in the world of utilities, whose companies customarily pay big dividends –sometimes reaching, or even exceeding, 80% of earnings. Our view: The more we can invest, the more we like it.Today, BHE has the operating talent and experience to manage truly huge utility projects – requiringinvestments of $100 billion or more – that could support infrastructure benefitting our country, our communities andour shareholders. We stand ready, willing and able to take on such opportunities.
9InvestmentsBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value. We excludeour Kraft Heinz holding – 325,442,152 shares – because Berkshire is part of a control group and therefore mustaccount for this investment on the “equity” method. On its balance sheet, Berkshire carries the Kraft Heinz holding ata GAAP figure of $13.8 billion, an amount that represents Berkshire’s share of the audited net worth of Kraft Heinzat December 31, 2019. Please note, though, that the market value of our shares on that date was only $10.5 billion. 12/31/19Shares*

What we see in our holdings, rather, is an assembly of companies that we partly own and that, on a weightedbasis, are earning more than20%on the net tangible equity capital required to run their businesses. These companies,also, earn their profits without employing excessive levels of debt.Returns of that order by large, established and understandable businesses are remarkable under anycircumstances. They are truly mind-blowing when compared to the returns that many investors have accepted onbonds over the last decade – 2
1⁄2% or even less on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, for example.
10Forecasting interest rates has never been our game, and Charlie and I have noidea what rates will average over the next year, or ten or thirty years. Our perhaps jaundiced view is that the pundits who opine on these subjectsreveal, by that very behavior, far more about themselves than they reveal about the future.What wecansay is thatifsomething close to current rates should prevail over the coming decades and if corporate tax rates also remain near the low level businesses now enjoy, it is almost certain that equities will over time perform far better than long-term, fixed-rate debt instruments.That rosy prediction comes with a warning:Anythingcan happen to stock prices tomorrow. Occasionally, there will be major drops in the market, perhaps of 50% magnitude or even greater. But the combination of TheAmerican Tailwind, about which I wrote last year, and the compounding wonders described by Mr. Smith, will makeequities the much better long-term choice for the individual who does not use borrowed money and who can controlhis or her emotions. Others? Beware!The Road AheadThree decades ago, my Midwestern friend, Joe Rosenfield, then in his 80s, received an irritating letter fromhis local newspaper. In blunt words, the paper asked for biographical data it planned to use in Joe’s obituary. Joedidn’t respond. So? A month later, he got a second letter from the paper, this one labeled “URGENT.”Charlie and I long ago entered the urgent zone. That’s not exactly great news for us. But Berkshireshareholders need not worry: Your company is 100% prepared for our departure.The two of us base our optimism upon five factors. First, Berkshire’s assets are deployed in an extraordinaryvariety of wholly or partly-owned businesses that, averaged out, earn attractive returns on the capital they use. Second,Berkshire’s positioning of its “controlled” businesses within a single entity endows it with some important andenduring economic advantages. Third, Berkshire’s financial affairs will unfailingly be managed in a manner allowingthe company to withstand external shocks of an extreme nature. Fourth, we possess skilled and devotedtop managers for whom running Berkshire is far more than simply having a high-paying and/or prestigious job. Finally, Berkshire’sdirectors – your guardians – are constantly focused on both the welfare of owners and the nurturing of a culture thatis rare among giant corporations. (The value of this culture is explored in Margin of Trust, a new book by Larry Cunningham and Stephanie Cuba that will be available at our annual meeting.)Charlie and I have very pragmatic reasons for wanting to assure Berkshire’s prosperity in the years followingour exit: The Mungers have Berkshire holdings that dwarf any of the family’s other investments, and I have a full 99%of my net worth lodged in Berkshire stock. I have never sold any shares and have no plans to do so. My only disposalof Berkshire shares, aside from charitable donations and minor personal gifts, took place in 1980, when I, along withother Berkshire stockholders who elected to participate, exchanged some of our Berkshire shares for the shares of anIllinois bank that Berkshire had purchased in 1969 and that, in 1980, needed to be offloaded because of changes in thebank holding company law.Today, my will specifically directs its executors – as well as the trustees who will succeed them inadministering my estate after the will is closed – not to sell anyBerkshire shares. My will also absolves both the executors and the trustees from liability for maintaining what obviously will be an extreme concentration of assets.The will goes on to instruct the executors – and, in time, the trustees – to each year convert a portion of myA shares into B shares and then distribute the Bs to various foundations. Those foundations will be required to deploytheir grants promptly. In all, I estimate that it will take 12 to 15 years for the entirety of the Berkshire shares I hold atmy death to move into the market.Absent my will’s directive that all my Berkshire shares should be held until their scheduled distribution dates,the “safe” course for both my executors and trustees would be to sell the Berkshire shares under their temporarycontrol and reinvest the proceeds in U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities matching the scheduled dates fordistributions. That strategy would leave the fiduciaries immune from both public criticism and the possibility ofpersonal liability for failure to act in accordance with the “prudent man” standard.11I myself feel comfortable that Berkshire shares will provide a safe and rewarding investment during thedisposal period. There is always a chance – unlikely, but not negligible – that events will prove me wrong. I believe,however, that there is a high probability that my directive will deliver substantially greater resources to society thanwould result from a conventional course of action.Key to my “Berkshire-only” instructions is my faith in the future judgment and fidelity of Berkshire directors.They will regularly be tested by Wall Streeters bearing fees. At many companies, these super-salesmen might win. Ido not, however, expect that to happen at Berkshire.Boards of DirectorsIn recent years, both the composition of corporate boards and their purpose have become hot topics. Once,debate about the responsibilities of boards was largely limited to lawyers; today, institutional investors and politicianshave weighed in as well.My credentials for discussing corporate governance include the fact that, over the last 62 years, I have servedas a director of 21 publicly-owned companies (listed below). In all but two of them, I have represented a substantialholding of stock. In a few cases, I have tried to implement important change.During the first 30 or so years of my services, it was rare to find a woman in the room unless she representeda family controlling the enterprise. This year, it should be noted, marks the 100
thanniversary of the 19thAmendment, which guaranteed American women the right to have their voices heard in a voting booth. Their attaining similar statusin a board room remains a work in progress.Over the years, many new rules and guidelines pertaining to board composition and duties have come intobeing. The bedrock challenge for directors, nevertheless, remains constant: Find and retain a talented CEO –possessing integrity, for sure – who will bedevotedto the company for his/her business lifetime. Often, that task is hard. When directors get it right, though, they need to do little else. But when they mess it up ,...... Audit committees now work much harder than they once did and almost always view the job with appropriateseriousness. Nevertheless, these committees remain no match for managers who wish to game numbers, an offensethat has been encouraged by the scourge of earnings “guidance” and the desire of CEOs to “hit the number.” My directexperience (limited, thankfully) with CEOs who have played with a company’s numbers indicates that they were moreoften prompted by ego than by a desire for financial gain.Compensation committees now rely much more heavily on consultants than they used to. Consequently,compensation arrangements have become more complicated – what committee member wants to explain paying largefees year after year for asimpleplan? – and the reading of proxy material has become a mind-numbing experience.Oneveryimportant improvement in corporate governance has been mandated: a regularly-scheduled“executive session” of directors at which the CEO is barred. Prior to that change, truly frank discussions of a CEO’sskills, acquisition decisions and compensation were rare.Acquisition proposals remain a particularly vexing problem for board members. The legal orchestration formaking deals has been refined and expanded (a word aptly describing attendant costs as well). But I have yet to see aCEO who craves an acquisition bring in an informed and articulate critic to argue against it. And yes, include meamong the guilty.
Berkshire, Blue Chip Stamps, Cap Cities-ABC, Coca-Cola, Data Documents, Dempster, General Growth, Gillette,Kraft Heinz, Maracaibo Oil, Munsingwear, Omaha National Bank, Pinkerton’s, Portland Gas Light, Salomon,Sanborn Map, Tribune Oil, U.S. Air, Vornado, Washington Post, Wesco Financial 12Overall, the deck is stacked in favor of the deal that’s coveted by the CEO and his/her obliging staff. It wouldbe an interesting exercise for a company to hire two “expert” acquisition advisors, one pro and one con, to deliver hisor her views on a proposed deal to the board – with the winning advisor to receive, say, ten times a token sum paid tothe loser. Don’t hold your breath awaiting this reform: The current system, whatever its shortcomings for shareholders,works magnificently for CEOs and the many advisors and other professionals who feast on deals. A venerable cautionwill forever be true when advice from Wall Street is contemplated: Don’t ask the barber whether you need a haircut.Over the years, board “independence” has become a new area of emphasis. One key point relating to thistopic, though, is almost invariably overlooked: Director compensation has now soared to a level that inevitably makespay a subconscious factor affecting the behavior of many non-wealthy members. Think, for a moment, of the directorearning $250,000-300,000 for board meetings consuming a pleasant couple of days six or so times a year. Frequently,the possession of one such directorship bestows on its holder three to four times the annualmedian income of U.S. households. (I missed much of this gravy train: As a director of Portland Gas Light in the early 1960s, I received $100annuallyfor my service. To earn this princely sum, I commuted to Maine four times a year.)And job security now? It’s fabulous. Board members may get politely ignored, but they seldom get fired.Instead, generous age limits – usually 70 or higher – act as the standard method for the genteel ejection of directors.Is it any wonder that a non-wealthy director (“NWD”) now hopes – or even yearns – to be asked to join asecond board, thereby vaulting into the $500,000-600,000 class? To achieve this goal, the NWD will need help. TheCEO of a company searching for board members will almost certainly check with the NWD’s current CEO as towhether NWD is a “good” director. “Good,” of course, is a code word. If the NWD has seriously challenged his/herpresent CEO’s compensation or acquisition dreams, his or her candidacy will silently die. When seeking directors,CEOs don’t look for pit bulls. It’s the cocker spaniel that gets taken home.Despite the illogic of it all, the director for whom fees are important – indeed, craved – is almost universallyclassified as “independent” while many directors possessing fortunes very substantially linked to the welfare of thecorporation are deemed lacking in independence. Not long ago, I looked at the proxy material of a large Americancompany and found thateightdirectors had never purchased a share of the company’s stock using their own money. (They, of course, had receivedgrantsof stock as a supplement to their generous cash compensation.) This particularcompany had long been a laggard, but the directors were doing wonderfully.Paid-with-my-own-money ownership, of course, does notcreate wisdom or ensure business smarts. Nevertheless, I feel better when directors of our portfolio companies have had the experience of purchasing shareswith their savings, rather than simply having been the recipients of grants. ************Here, a pause is due: I’d like you to know that almost all of the directors I have met over the years have beendecent, likable and intelligent. They dressed well, made good neighbors and were fine citizens. I’ve enjoyed theircompany. Among the group are some men and women that I would not have met except for our mutual board serviceand who have become close friends.Nevertheless, many of these good souls are people whom I would never have chosen to handle money orbusiness matters. It simply was not their game.They, in turn, would never have asked me for help in removing a tooth, decorating their home or improvingtheir golf swing. Moreover, if I were ever scheduled to appear on Dancing With the Stars, I would immediately seek refuge in the Witness Protection Program. We are all duds at one thing or another. For most of us, the list is long. Theimportant point to recognize is that if you are Bobby Fischer, you must play onlychess for money. At Berkshire, we will continue to look for business-savvy directors who are owner-oriented and arrive witha strong specific interest in our company. Thought and principles, not robot-like “process,” will guide their actions.In representingyourinterests, they will, of course, seek managers whose goals include delighting their customers,cherishing their associates and acting as good citizens of both their communities and our country.13Those objectives are not new. They were the goals of able CEOs sixty years ago and remain so. Who wouldhave it otherwise?Short SubjectsIn past reports, we’ve discussed both the sense and nonsense of stock repurchases. Our thinking, boiled down:Berkshire will buy back its stock only if a) Charlie and I believe that it is selling for less than it is worth and b) thecompany, upon completing the repurchase, is left with ample cash.Calculations of intrinsic value are far from precise. Consequently, neither of us feels any urgency to buy anestimated$1 of value for a very real 95 cents. In 2019, the Berkshire price/value equation was modestlyfavorable at times, and we spent $5 billion in repurchasing about 1% of the company.Over time, we want Berkshire’s share count to go down. If the price-to-value discount (as we estimate it) widens, we will likely become more aggressive in purchasing shares. We will not, however, prop the stock at anylevel.Shareholders having at least $20 million in value of A or B shares and an inclination to sell shares to Berkshiremay wish to have their broker contact Berkshire’s Mark Millard at 402-346-1400. We request that you phone Markbetween 8:00-8:30 a.m. or 3:00-3:30 p.m. Central Time, calling only if you are ready to sell. ************In 2019, Berkshire sent $3.6 billion to the U.S. Treasury to pay its current income tax. The U.S. governmentcollected $243 billion from corporate income tax payments during the same period. From these statistics, you can takepride that your company delivered 1
1⁄2% of the federal income taxes paid byallof corporate America. Fifty-five years ago, when Berkshire entered its current incarnation, the company paid nothingin federal income tax. (For good reason, too: Over the previous decade, the struggling business had recorded a net loss.) Sincethen, as Berkshire retained nearly all of its earnings, the beneficiaries of that policy became not only the company’sshareholders but also the federal government. In most future years, we both hope and expect to send farlarger sums to the Treasury. ************On pages A-2 – A-3, you will find details about our annual meeting, which will be held on May 2, 2020.Yahoo, as usual, will be streaming the event worldwide. There will be one important change, however, in our format:I’ve had suggestions from shareholders, media and board members that Ajit Jain and Greg Abel – our two keyoperating managers – be given more exposure at the meeting. That change makes great sense. They are outstandingindividuals, both as managers and as human beings, and you should hear more from them.Shareholders who this year send a question to be asked by our three long-serving journalists may specify thatit be posed to Ajit or Greg. They, like Charlie and me, will not have even a hint of what the questions will be.The journalists will alternate questions with those from the audience, who also can direct questions to any ofthe four of us. So polish up your zingers. ************On May 2
nd, come to Omaha. Meet your fellow capitalists. Buy some Berkshire products. Have fun. Charlieand I – along with the entire Berkshire gang – are looking forward to seeing you.February 22, 2020 Warren E. Buffett Chairman of the Board14Berkshire’s Performance vs. the S&P 500

2BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:Berkshire earned $42.5 billion in 2020 according to generally accepted accounting principles (commonlycalled “GAAP”). The four components of that figure are $21.9 billion of operating earnings, $4.9 billion of realizedcapital gains, a $26.7 billion gain from an increase in the amount of net unrealizedcapital gains that exist in the stocks we hold and, finally, an $11 billionlossfrom a write-down in the value of a few subsidiary and affiliate businessesthat we own. All items are stated on an after-tax basis.Operating earningsare what count most, even during periods when they are notthe largest item in our GAAP total. Our focus at Berkshire is both to increase this segment of our income and to acquire large and favorably-situatedbusinesses. Last year, however, we met neither goal: Berkshire made no sizable acquisitions and operating earningsfell9%. We did, though, increase Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic value by both retaining earnings and repurchasingabout 5% of our shares.The two GAAP components pertaining to capital gains or losses (whether realized or unrealized) fluctuatecapriciously from year to year, reflecting swings in the stock market. Whatever today’sfigures, Charlie Munger, my long-time partner, and I firmly believe that, over time, Berkshire’s capital gains from its investment holdings will besubstantial.As I’ve emphasized many times, Charlie and I view Berkshire’s holdings of marketable stocks – at yearendworth $281 billion – as a collection ofbusinesses. We don’t control the operations of those companies, but we do share proportionately in their long-term prosperity. From an accounting standpoint, however, our portion of theirearningsisnotincluded in Berkshire’s income. Instead, only what these investees pay us in dividends is recorded onour books. Under GAAP, the huge sums that investees retain on our behalf become invisible.What’s out of sight, however, shouldnotbe out of mind: Those unrecorded retained earnings are usually building value –lotsof value – for Berkshire. Investees use the withheld funds to expand their business, makeacquisitions, pay off debt and, often, to repurchase their stock (an act that increases our share of their future earnings).As we pointed out in these pages last year, retained earnings have propelled American business throughout ourcountry’s history. What worked for Carnegie and Rockefeller has, over the years, worked its magic for millions ofshareholders as well.Of course, some of our investees will disappoint, adding little, if anything, to the value of their company byretaining earnings. But others will over-deliver, a few spectacularly. In aggregate, we expect our share of the hugepile of earnings retained by Berkshire’s non-controlled businesses (what others would label our equity portfolio) toeventually deliver us an equal or greater amount of capital gains. Over our 56-year tenure, that expectation has beenmet.
3The final component in our GAAP figure – that ugly $11 billion write-down – is almost entirely thequantification of a mistake I made in 2016. That year, Berkshire purchased Precision Castparts (“PCC”), and I paidtoo much for the company.No one misled me in any way – I was simply too optimistic about PCC’s normalized profit potential. Lastyear, my miscalculation was laid bare by adverse developments throughout the aerospace industry, PCC’s mostimportant source of customers.In purchasing PCC, Berkshire bought a fine company – the best in its business. Mark Donegan, PCC’s CEO,is a passionate manager who consistently pours the same energy into the business that he did before we purchased it.We are lucky to have him running things.I believe I was right in concluding that PCC would, over time, earn good returns on the net tangible assetsdeployed in its operations. I was wrong, however, in judging the averageamount of future earnings and, consequently, wrong in my calculation of the proper price to pay for the business.PCC is far from my first error of that sort. But it’s a big one.Two Strings to Our BowBerkshire is often labeled a conglomerate, a negative term applied to holding companies that own ahodge-podge of unrelated businesses. And, yes, that describes Berkshire – but only in part. To understand how andwhy we differ from the prototype conglomerate, let’s review a little history.Over time, conglomerates have generally limited themselves to buying businesses in their entirety. That strategy, however, came with two major problems. One was unsolvable: Most of the truly great businesses had nointerest in havinganyonetake them over. Consequently, deal-hungry conglomerateurs had to focus on so-socompanies that lacked important and durable competitive strengths. That was not a great pond in which to fish.Beyond that, as conglomerateurs dipped into this universe of mediocre businesses, they often foundthemselves required to pay staggering “control” premiums to snare their quarry. Aspiring conglomerateurs knew theanswer to this “overpayment” problem: They simply needed to manufacture a vastly overvalued stock of their ownthat could be used as a “currency” for pricey acquisitions. (“I’ll pay you $10,000 for your dog by giving you two ofmy $5,000 cats.”)Often, the tools for fostering the overvaluation of a conglomerate’s stock involved promotional techniquesand “imaginative” accounting maneuvers that were, at best, deceptive and that sometimes crossed the line into fraud.When these tricks were “successful,” the conglomerate pushed its own stock to, say, 3x its business value in order tooffer the target 2xitsvalue.Investing illusions can continue for a surprisingly long time. Wall Street loves the fees that deal-makinggenerates, and the press loves the stories that colorful promoters provide. At a point, also, the soaring price of apromoted stock can itself become the “proof” that an illusion is reality.
4Eventually, of course, the party ends, and many business “emperors” are found to have no clothes. Financialhistory is replete with the names of famous conglomerateurs who were initially lionized as business geniuses byjournalists, analysts and investment bankers, but whose creations ended up as business junkyards.Conglomeratesearnedtheir terrible reputation.************Charlie and I want our conglomerate toownall or part of a diverse group of businesses with good economic characteristics and good managers. Whether Berkshire controlsthese businesses, however, is unimportant to us. It took me a while to wise up. But Charlie – and also my 20-year struggle with the textile operation I inheritedat Berkshire – finally convinced me that owning a non-controlling portion of a wonderful business is more profitable,more enjoyable andfarless work than struggling with 100% of a marginal enterprise.For those reasons,ourconglomerate will remain a collection of controlled andnon-controlled businesses. Charlie and I will simply deploy your capital into whatever we believe makes the most sense, based on a company’sdurable competitive strengths, the capabilities and character of its management, and price.If that strategy requires little or no effort on our part, so much the better. In contrast to the scoring systemutilized in diving competitions, you are awarded nopoints in business endeavors for “degree of difficulty.” Furthermore, as Ronald Reagan cautioned: “It’s said that hard work never killed anyone, but Isay why take the chance?”The Family Jewels and How We Increase Your Share of These GemsOn page A-1 we list Berkshire’s subsidiaries, a smorgasbord of businesses employing 360,000 at yearend.You can read much more about these controlled operations in the 10-K that fills the back part of this report. Our majorpositions in companies that we partly own and don’tcontrol are listed on page 7 of this letter. That portfolio of businesses, too, is large and diverse.Mostof Berkshire’s value, however, resides in four businesses, three controlled and one in which we haveonly a 5.4% interest. All four are jewels.The largest in value is our property/casualty insurance operation, which for 53 years has been the core ofBerkshire. Our family of insurers is unique in the insurance field. So, too, is its manager, Ajit Jain, who joinedBerkshire in 1986.Overall, the insurance fleet operates withfarmore capital than is deployed by any of its competitors worldwide. That financial strength, coupled with the huge flow of cashBerkshire annually receives from its non-insurancebusinesses, allows our insurance companies to safely follow an equity-heavy investment strategy notfeasible for the overwhelming majority of insurers. Those competitors, for both regulatory and credit-rating reasons,mustfocus on bonds.And bonds arenot the place to be these days. Can you believe that the income recently available from a10-year U.S. Treasury bond – the yield was 0.93% at yearend – had fallen 94%from the 15.8% yield available in September 1981? In certain large and important countries, such as Germany and Japan, investors earn a negativereturn on trillions of dollars of sovereign debt. Fixed-income investors worldwide – whether pension funds, insurancecompanies or retirees – face a bleak future.
5Some insurers, as well as other bond investors, may try to juice the pathetic returns now available by shiftingtheir purchases to obligations backed by shaky borrowers. Risky loans, however, are notthe answer to inadequate interest rates. Three decades ago, the once-mighty savings and loan industry destroyed itself, partly by ignoring thatmaxim.Berkshire now enjoys $138 billion of insurance “float” – funds that do not belong to us, but are neverthelessours to deploy, whether in bonds, stocks or cash equivalents such as U.S. Treasury bills. Float has some similaritiesto bank deposits: cash flows in and out daily to insurers, with the total they hold changing very little. The massivesum held by Berkshire is likely to remain near its present level for many years and, on a cumulative basis, has beencostlessto us. That happy result, of course, could change – but, over time, I like our odds.I have repetitiously – some might say endlessly – explained our insurance operation in my annual letters toyou. Therefore, I will this year ask new shareholders who wish to learn more about our insurance business and “float”to read the pertinent section of the 2019 report, reprinted on page A-2. It’s important that you understand the risks,as well as the opportunities, existing in our insurance activities.Our second and third most valuable assets – it’s pretty much a toss-up at this point – are Berkshire’s 100%ownership of BNSF, America’s largest railroad measured by freight volume, and our 5.4% ownership of Apple. Andin the fourth spot is our 91% ownership of Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”). What we have here is a very unusualutility business, whose annual earnings have grown from $122 million to $3.4 billionduring our 21 years of ownership. I’ll have more to say about BNSF and BHE later in this letter. For now, however, I would like to focus on apractice Berkshire will periodically use to enhance yourinterest in both its “Big Four” as well as the many other assets Berkshire owns.************
Last year we demonstrated our enthusiasm for Berkshire’s spread of properties by repurchasing theequivalent of 80,998 “A” shares, spending $24.7 billion in the process. That action increased yourownership inallof Berkshire’s businesses by 5.2%withoutrequiring you to so much as touch your wallet.
Following criteria Charlie and I have long recommended, we made those purchases because we believed theywould both enhance the intrinsic value per share for continuing shareholders andwould leave Berkshire with more than ample funds for any opportunities or problems it might encounter.In no way do we think that Berkshire shares should be repurchased at simply any price. I emphasize thatpoint because American CEOs have an embarrassing record of devoting more company funds to repurchases whenprices have risen than when they have tanked. Our approach is exactly the reverse.Berkshire’s investment in Apple vividly illustrates the power of repurchases. We began buying Apple stocklate in 2016 and by early July 2018, owned slightly more than one billion Apple shares (split-adjusted). Saying that,I’m referencing the investment held in Berkshire’s general account and am excluding a very small andseparately-managed holding of Apple shares that was subsequently sold. When we finished our purchases inmid-2018, Berkshire’s general account owned 5.2% of Apple.Our cost for that stake was $36 billion. Since then, we have both enjoyed regular dividends, averaging about$775 million annually, and have also – in 2020 – pocketed an additional $11 billion by selling a small portion of ourposition.Despite that sale – voila! – Berkshire now owns 5.4% of Apple. That increase was costlessto us, coming about because Apple has continuously repurchased its shares, thereby substantially shrinking the number it now hasoutstanding.
6But that’s far from all of the good news. Because we also repurchased Berkshireshares during the 21⁄2years, younow indirectly own a full 10% more of Apple’s assets and future earnings than you did in July 2018.This agreeable dynamic continues. Berkshire has repurchased more shares since yearend and is likely tofurther reduce its share count in the future. Apple has publicly stated an intention to repurchase its shares as well. Asthese reductions occur, Berkshire shareholders will not only own a greater interest in our insurance group and in BNSFand BHE, but will also find their indirect ownership of Apple increasing as well.The math of repurchases grinds away slowly, but can be powerful over time. The process offers a simple wayfor investors to own an ever-expanding portion of exceptional businesses.And as a sultry Mae West assured us: “Too much of a good thing can be . . . wonderful.” InvestmentsBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend were our largest in market value. Weexclude our Kraft Heinz holding — 325,442,152 shares — because Berkshire is part of a control group and thereforemust account for that investment using the “equity” method. On its balance sheet, Berkshire carries the Kraft Heinzholding at a GAAP figure of $13.3 billion, an amount that represents Berkshire’s share of the audited net worth ofKraft Heinz on December 31, 2020. Please note, though, that the market value of our shares on that date was only$11.3 billion. 12/31/20Shares*

7A Tale of Two CitiesSuccess stories abound throughout America. Since our country’s birth, individuals with an idea, ambitionand often just a pittance of capital have succeeded beyond their dreams by creating something new or by improvingthe customer’s experience with something old.Charlie and I journeyed throughout the nation to join with many of these individuals or their families. On theWest Coast, we began the routine in 1972 with our purchase of See’s Candy. A full century ago, Mary See set out todeliver an age-old product that she had reinvented with special recipes. Added to her business plan were quaint storesstaffed by friendly salespeople. Her first small outlet in Los Angeles eventually led to several hundred shops, spreadthroughout the West.Today, Mrs. See’s creations continue to delight customers while providing life-long employment forthousands of women and men. Berkshire’s job is simply not to meddle with the company’s success. When a businessmanufactures and distributes a non-essential consumer product, the customeris the boss. And, after 100 years, the customer’s message to Berkshire remains clear: “Don’t mess with mycandy.” (The website is https://www.sees.com/; try the peanut brittle.)Let’s move across the continent to Washington, D.C. In 1936, Leo Goodwin, along with his wife, Lillian,became convinced that auto insurance – a standardized product customarily purchased from agents – could be solddirectly at a much lower price. Armed with $100,000, the pair took on giant insurers possessing 1,000 times or moretheir capital. Government Employees Insurance Company (later shortened to GEICO) was on its way.By luck, I was exposed to the company’s potential a full 70 years ago. It instantly became my first love (ofan investment sort). You know the rest of the story: Berkshire eventually became the 100% owner of GEICO, whichat 84 years of age is constantly fine-tuning – but not changing – the vision of Leo and Lillian.There has been, however, a change in the company’s size. In 1937, its first full year of operation, GEICO did$238,288 of business. Last year the figure was $35 billion.************Today, with much of finance, media, government and tech located in coastal areas, it’s easy to overlook themany miracles occurring in middle America. Let’s focus on two communities that provide stunning illustrations ofthe talent and ambition existingthroughoutour country.You will not be surprised that I begin with Omaha.In 1940, Jack Ringwalt, a graduate of Omaha’s Central High School (the alma mater as well of Charlie, mydad, my first wife, our three children and two grandchildren), decided to start a property/casualty insurance companyfunded by $125,000 in capital.
Jack’s dream was preposterous, requiring his pipsqueak operation – somewhat pompously christened asNational Indemnity – to compete with giant insurers, all of which operated with abundant capital. Additionally, thosecompetitors were solidly entrenched with nationwide networks of well-funded and long-established local agents.Under Jack’s plan, National Indemnity, unlike GEICO, would itself use whatever agencies deigned to accept it andconsequently enjoynocost advantage in its acquisition of business. To overcome those formidable handicaps,National Indemnity focused on “odd-ball” risks, which were deemed unimportant by the “big boys.” And, improbably,the strategy succeeded.
Jack was honest, shrewd, likeable and a bit quirky. In particular, he disliked regulators. When he periodicallybecame annoyed with their supervision, he would feel an urge to sell his company.8Fortunately, I was nearby on one of those occasions. Jack liked the idea of joining Berkshire, and we made adeal in 1967, taking all of 15 minutes to reach a handshake. I never asked for an audit.Today National Indemnity is theonlycompany in the world prepared to insure certain giant risks. And, yes,it remains based in Omaha, a few miles from Berkshire’s home office.Over the years, we have purchased four additional businesses from Omaha families, the best known amongthem being Nebraska Furniture Mart (“NFM”). The company’s founder, Rose Blumkin (“Mrs. B”), arrived in Seattlein 1915 as a Russian emigrant, unable to read or speak English. She settled in Omaha several years later and by 1936had saved $2,500 with which to start a furniture store.Competitors and suppliers ignored her, and for a time their judgment seemed correct: World War II stalledher business, and at yearend 1946, the company’s net worth had grown to only $72,264. Cash, both in the till and ondeposit, totaled $50 (that’s not a typo).One invaluable asset, however, went unrecorded in the 1946 figures: Louie Blumkin, Mrs. B’s only son, hadrejoined the store after four years in the U.S. Army. Louie fought at Normandy’s Omaha Beach following the D-Dayinvasion, earned a Purple Heart for injuries sustained in the Battle of the Bulge, and finally sailed home in November1945.Once Mrs. B and Louie were reunited, there was no stopping NFM. Driven by their dream, mother and sonworked days, nights and weekends. The result was a retailing miracle.By 1983, the pair had created a business worth $60 million. That year, on my birthday, Berkshire purchased80% of NFM, again without an audit. I counted on Blumkin family members to run the business; the third and fourthgeneration do so today. Mrs. B, it should be noted, worked daily until she was 103 – a ridiculously prematureretirement age as judged by Charlie and me.NFM now owns the three largest home-furnishings stores in the U.S. Each set a sales record in 2020, a featachieved despite the closing of NFM’s stores for more than six weeks because of COVID-19.A post-script to this story says it all: When Mrs. B’s large family gathered for holiday meals, she alwaysasked that they sing a song before eating. Her selection never varied: Irving Berlin’s “God Bless America.”************Let’s move somewhat east to Knoxville, the third largest city in Tennessee. There, Berkshire has ownershipintworemarkable companies – Clayton Homes (100% owned) and Pilot Travel Centers (38% owned now, but headedfor 80% in 2023).Each company was started by a young man who had graduated from the University of Tennessee and stayedput in Knoxville. Neither had a meaningful amount of capital nor wealthy parents.But, so what? Today, Clayton and Pilot each have annualpre-tax earnings of more than$1 billion. Together they employ about 47,000 men and women.Jim Clayton, after several other business ventures, founded Clayton Homes on a shoestring in 1956, and “BigJim” Haslam started what became Pilot Travel Centers in 1958 by purchasing a service station for $6,000. Each of themen later brought into the business a son with the same passion, values and brains as his father. Sometimes there is amagic to genes.
9“Big Jim” Haslam, now 90, has recently authored an inspirational book in which he relates how Jim Clayton’s son, Kevin, encouraged the Haslams to sell a large portion of Pilot to Berkshire. Every retailer knows that satisfiedcustomers are a store’s best salespeople. That’s true when businesses are changing hands as well.************When you next fly over Knoxville or Omaha, tip your hat to the Claytons, Haslams and Blumkins as well asto the army of successful entrepreneurs who populate every part of our country. These builders needed America’sframework for prosperity – a unique experiment when it was crafted in 1789 – to achieve their potential. In turn,America needed citizens like Jim C., Jim H., Mrs. B and Louie to accomplish the miracles our founding fathers sought.Today, many people forge similar miraclesthroughoutthe world, creating a spread of prosperity that benefits allof humanity. In its brief 232 years of existence, however, there has been noincubator for unleashing human potential like America. Despite some severe interruptions, our country’s economic progress has been breathtaking.Beyond that, we retain our constitutional aspiration of becoming “a more perfect union.” Progress on thatfront has been slow, uneven and often discouraging. We have, however, moved forward and will continue to do so.Our unwavering conclusion:Neverbet against America.The Berkshire PartnershipBerkshire is a Delaware corporation, and our directors must follow the state’s laws. Among them is arequirement that board membersmustact in the best interest of the corporation and its stockholders. Our directorsembrace that doctrine.In addition, of course, Berkshire directors want the company to delight its customers, to develop and rewardthe talents of its 360,000 associates, to behave honorably with lenders and to be regarded as a good citizen of the manycities and states in which we operate. We value these four important constituencies.None of these groups, however, have avotein determining such matters as dividends, strategic direction, CEO selection, or acquisitions and divestitures. Responsibilities like those fall solelyon Berkshire’s directors, who must faithfully represent the long-term interests of the corporation and its owners. Beyond legal requirements, Charlie and I feel a special obligation to the many individualshareholders of Berkshire. A bit of personal history may help you to understand our unusual attachment and how it shapes ourbehavior.************Before my Berkshire years, I managed money for many individuals through a series of partnerships, the firstthree of those formed in 1956. As time passed, the use of multiple entities became unwieldy and, in 1962, weamalgamated 12 partnerships into a single unit, Buffett Partnership Ltd. (“BPL”).By that year, virtually all of my own money, and that of my wife as well, had become invested alongside thefunds of my many limited partners. I received no salary or fees. Instead, as the general partner, I was compensated bymy limited partners only after they secured returns above an annual threshold of 6%. If returns failed to meet thatlevel, the shortfall was to be carried forward against my share of future profits. (Fortunately, that never happened:Partnership returns always exceeded the 6% “bogey.”) As the years went by, a large part of the resources of myparents, siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins and in-laws became invested in the partnership.
10Charlie formed his partnership in 1962 and operated much as I did. Neither of us had anyinstitutional investors, and very few of our partners were financially sophisticated. The people who joined our ventures simplytrusted us to treat their money as we treated our own. These individuals – either intuitively or by relying on the adviceof friends – correctly concluded that Charlie and I had an extreme aversion to permanent loss of capital and that wewould not have accepted their money unless we expected to do reasonably well with it.I stumbled intobusinessmanagement after BPL acquired control of Berkshire in 1965. Later still, in 1969,we decided to dissolve BPL. After yearend, the partnership distributed, pro-rata, all of its cash along with three stocks,the largest by value being BPL’s 70.5% interest in Berkshire.Charlie, meanwhile, wound up his operation in 1977. Among the assets he distributed to partners was a majorinterest in Blue Chip Stamps, a company his partnership, Berkshire and I jointly controlled. Blue Chip was also amongthe three stocks my partnership had distributed upon its dissolution.In 1983, Berkshire and Blue Chip merged, thereby expanding Berkshire’s base of registered shareholdersfrom 1,900 to 2,900. Charlie and I wanted everyone – old, new and prospectiveshareholders – to be on the same page. Therefore, the 1983 annual report – up front – laid out Berkshire’s “major business principles.” The first principle began: “Although our form is corporate, our attitude is partnership.” That defined our relationship in 1983;it defines it today. Charlie and I – and our directors as well – believe this dictum will serve Berkshire well for manydecades to come.************Ownership of Berkshire now resides in five large “buckets,” one occupied by me as a “founder” of sorts.That bucket is certain to empty as the shares I own are annually distributed to various philanthropies.Two of the remaining four buckets are filled by institutional investors, each handling other people’s money. That, however, is where the similarity between those buckets ends: Their investing procedures could not be moredifferent.In one institutional bucket are index funds, a large and mushrooming segment of the investment world. Thesefunds simply mimic the index that they track. The favorite of index investors is the S&P 500, of which Berkshire is acomponent. Index funds, it should be emphasized, own Berkshire shares simply because they are requiredto do so. They are on automatic pilot, buying and selling onlyfor “weighting” purposes.In the other institutional bucket are professionals who managetheir clients’ money, whether those funds belong to wealthy individuals, universities, pensioners or whomever. These professional managers have a mandate tomove funds from one investment to another based on their judgment as to valuation and prospects. That is anhonorable, though difficult, occupation.We are happy to work for this “active” group, while they meanwhile search for a better place to deploy thefunds of their clientele. Some managers, to be sure, have a long-term focus and trade very infrequently. Others usecomputers employing algorithms that may direct the purchase or sale of shares in a nano-second. Some professionalinvestors will come and go based upon their macro-economic judgments.Our fourth bucket consists of individual shareholders who operate in a manner similar to the activeinstitutional managers I’ve just described. These owners, understandably, think of their Berkshire shares as a possiblesource of funds when they see another investment that excites them. We have no quarrel with that attitude, which issimilar to the way we look atsomeof the equities we own at Berkshire.
11All of that said, Charlie and I would be less than human if we did not feel a special kinship with our fifthbucket: the million-plusindividualinvestors who simply trust us to represent their interests, whatever the future maybring. They have joined us with no intent to leave, adopting a mindset similar to that held by our original partners.Indeed, many investors from our partnership years, and/or their descendants, remain substantial owners of Berkshire.A prototype of those veterans is Stan Truhlsen, a cheerful and generous Omaha ophthalmologist as well aspersonal friend, who turned 100 on November 13, 2020. In 1959, Stan, along with 10 other young Omaha doctors,formed a partnership with me. The docs creatively labeled their venture Emdee, Ltd. Annually, they joined my wifeand me for a celebratory dinner at our home.When our partnership distributed its Berkshire shares in 1969, allof the doctors kept the stock they received. They may not have known the ins and outs of investing or accounting, but they didknow that at Berkshire they would be treated as partners.Two of Stan’s comrades from Emdee are now in their high-90s and continue to hold Berkshire shares. Thisgroup’s startling durability – along with the fact that Charlie and I are 97 and 90, respectively – serves up an interestingquestion: Could it be that Berkshire ownership fosters longevity?************Berkshire’s unusual and valued family of individual shareholders may add to your understanding of ourreluctance to court Wall Street analysts and institutional investors. We already havethe investors we want and don’t think that they, on balance, would be upgraded by replacements.
There are only so many seats – that is, shares outstanding – available for Berkshire ownership. And we verymuch like the people already occupying them.
Of course, some turnover in “partners” will occur. Charlie and I hope, however, that it will be minimal. Who,after all, seeks rapid turnover in friends, neighbors or marriage?In 1958, Phil Fisher wrote a superb book on investing. In it, he analogized running a public company tomanaging a restaurant. If you are seeking diners, he said, you can attract a clientele and prosper featuring either hamburgers served with a Cokeora French cuisine accompanied by exotic wines. But you must not, Fisher warned,capriciously switch from one to the other: Your message to potential customers must be consistent with what they willfind upon entering your premises.At Berkshire, we have been serving hamburgers and Coke for 56 years. We cherish the clientele this fare hasattracted.The tens of millions of other investors and speculators in the United States and elsewhere have a wide varietyof equity choices to fittheirtastes. They will find CEOs and market gurus with enticing ideas. If they want pricetargets, managed earnings and “stories,” they will not lack suitors. “Technicians” will confidently instruct them as towhat some wiggles on a chart portend for a stock’s next move. The calls for action will never stop.Many of those investors, I should add, will do quite well. After all, ownership of stocks is very much a“positive-sum” game. Indeed, a patient and level-headed monkey, who constructs a portfolio by throwing 50 darts ata board listing all of the S&P 500, will –over time– enjoy dividends and capital gains, just as long as it nevergets tempted to make changes in its original “selections.”
12Productive assets such as farms, real estate and, yes, business ownership producewealth – lots of it. Most owners of such properties will be rewarded. All that’s required is the passage of time, an inner calm, amplediversification and a minimization of transactions and fees. Still, investors must never forget that their expensesare Wall Street’sincome. And, unlike my monkey, Wall Streeters do not work for peanuts.When seats open up at Berkshire – and we hope they are few – we want them to be occupied by newcomerswho understand and desire what we offer. After decades of management, Charlie and I remain unable to promiseresults. Wecananddo, however, pledge to treat you as partners.And so, too, will our successors.A Berkshire Number that May Surprise You
Recently, I learned a fact about our company that I had never suspected: Berkshire owns American-based property, plant and equipment – the sort of assets that make up the “business infrastructure” of our country – with aGAAP valuation exceeding the amount owned by anyother U.S. company. Berkshire’s depreciated cost of these domestic“fixed assets” is $154 billion. Next in line on this list is AT&T, with property, plant and equipment of $127billion.
Our leadership in fixed-asset ownership, I should add, does not, in itself, signal an investment triumph. The bestresults occur at companies that requireminimalassets to conduct high-margin businesses –andoffer goods or services that will expand their sales volume with only minor needs for additional capital. We, in fact, own a few ofthese exceptional businesses, but they are relatively small and, at best, grow slowly.
Asset-heavy companies, however, can begoodinvestments. Indeed, we are delighted with our two giants – BNSF and BHE: In 2011, Berkshire’s first full year of BNSF ownership, the two companies had combinedearnings of $4.2 billion. In 2020, a tough year for many businesses, the pair earned $8.3 billion.
BNSF and BHE will require major capital expenditures for decades to come. The good news is that both arelikely to deliver appropriate returns on the incremental investment.Let’s look first at BNSF. Your railroad carries about 15% of all non-local ton-miles (a ton of freight movedone mile) of goods that move in the United States, whether by rail, truck, pipeline, barge or aircraft. By a significantmargin, BNSF’s loads top those of any other carrier.The history of American railroads is fascinating. After 150 years or so of frenzied construction, skullduggery,overbuilding, bankruptcies, reorganizations and mergers, the railroad industry finally emerged a few decades ago asmature and rationalized.BNSF began operations in 1850 with a 12-mile line in northeastern Illinois. Today, it has 390 antecedentswhose railroads have been purchased or merged. The company’s extensive lineage is laid out athttp://www.bnsf.com/bnsf-resources/pdf/about-bnsf/History_and_Legacy.pdf.
Berkshire acquired BNSF early in 2010. Since our purchase, the railroad has invested $41 billion in fixedassets, an outlay $20 billion in excess of its depreciation charges. Railroading is an outdoor sport, featuring mile-longtrains obliged to reliably operate in both extreme cold and heat, as they all the while encounter every form of terrainfrom deserts to mountains. Massive flooding periodically occurs. BNSF owns 23,000 miles of track, spread throughout28 states, and must spend whatever it takes to maximize safety and service throughout its vast system.
13Nevertheless, BNSF has paid substantial dividends to Berkshire – $41.8 billion in total. The railroad pays us,however, only what remains after it both fulfills the needs of its business and maintains a cash balance of about$2 billion. This conservative policy allows BNSF to borrow at low rates, independent of any guarantee of its debt byBerkshire.
One further word about BNSF: Last year, Carl Ice, its CEO, and his number two, Katie Farmer, did anextraordinary job in controlling expenses while navigating a significant downturn in business. Despite a 7% declinein the volume of goods carried, the two actually increased BNSF’s profit margin by 2.9 percentage points. Carl, aslong planned, retired at yearend and Katie took over as CEO. Your railroad is in good hands.BHE, unlike BNSF, paysnodividends on its common stock, a highly-unusual practice in the electric-utilityindustry. That Spartan policy has been the case throughout our 21 years of ownership. Unlike railroads, our country’selectric utilities need a massive makeover in which the ultimate costs will be staggering. The effort will absorb all ofBHE’s earnings for decades to come. We welcome the challenge and believe the added investment will beappropriately rewarded.
Let me tell you about one of BHE’s endeavors – its $18 billion commitment to rework and expand asubstantial portion of the outdated grid that now transmits electricity throughout the West. BHE began this project in2006 and expects it to be completed by 2030 – yes, 2030.
The advent of renewable energy made our project a societal necessity. Historically, the coal-based generationof electricity that long prevailed was located close to huge centers of population. The best sites for the new world ofwind and solar generation, however, are often in remote areas. When BHE assessed the situation in 2006, it was nosecret that a huge investment in western transmission lines had to be made. Very few companies or governmentalentities, however, were in a financial position to raise their hand after they tallied the project’s cost.BHE’s decision to proceed, it should be noted, was based upon its trust in America’s political, economic andjudicial systems. Billions of dollars needed to be invested before meaningful revenue would flow. Transmission lineshad to cross the borders of states and other jurisdictions, each with its own rules and constituencies. BHE would alsoneed to deal with hundreds of landowners and execute complicated contracts with both the suppliers that generatedrenewable power and the far-away utilities that would distribute the electricity to their customers. Competing interestsand defenders of the old order, along with unrealistic visionaries desiring an instantly-new world, had to be brought onboard.Both surprises and delays were certain. Equally certain, however, was the fact that BHE had the managerialtalent, the institutional commitment and the financial wherewithal to fulfill its promises. Though it will be many yearsbefore our western transmission project is completed, we are today searching for other projects of similar size to takeon.Whatever the obstacles, BHE will be a leader in delivering ever-cleaner energy.The Annual MeetingLast year, on February 22
nd, I wrote you about our plans for a gala annual meeting. Within a month, theschedule was junked.Our home office group, led by Melissa Shapiro and Marc Hamburg, Berkshire’s CFO, quickly regrouped.Miraculously, their improvisations worked. Greg Abel, one of Berkshire’s Vice Chairmen, joined me on stage facinga dark arena, 18,000 empty seats and a camera. There was no rehearsal: Greg and I arrived about 45 minutes before“showtime.”
14Debbie Bosanek, my incredible assistant who joined Berkshire 47 years ago at age 17, had put together about25 slides displaying various facts and figures that I had assembled at home. An anonymous but highly-capable teamof computer and camera operators projected the slides onto the screen in proper order.Yahoo streamed the proceedings to a record-sized international audience. Becky Quick of CNBC, operatingfrom her home in New Jersey, selected questions from thousands that shareholders had earlier submitted or thatviewers had emailed to her during the four hours Greg and I were on stage. See’s peanut brittle and fudge, along withCoca-Cola, provided us with nourishment.This year, on May 1
st, we are planning to go one better. Again, we will rely on Yahoo and CNBC to performflawlessly. Yahoo will go live at 1 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (“EDT”). Simply navigate tohttps://finance.yahoo.com/brklivestream.
Our formal meeting will commence at 5:00 p.m. EDT and should finish by 5:30 p.m. Earlier, between1:30-5:00, we will answer your questions as relayed by Becky. As always, we will have no foreknowledge as to whatquestions will be asked. Send your zingers to BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com. Yahoo will wrap things up after 5:30.
And now – drum roll, please – a surprise. This year our meeting will be held in Los Angeles ...a n dCharlie will be on stage with meoffering answers and observations throughout the 3
1⁄2-hour question period. I missed him last year and, more important,youclearly missed him. Our other invaluable vice-chairmen, Ajit Jain and Greg Abel, willbe with us to answer questions relating to their domains.
Join us via Yahoo. Direct your really tough questions to Charlie! We will have fun, and we hope you will aswell.
Better yet, of course, will be the day when we see you face to face. I hope and expect that will be in 2022.The citizens of Omaha, our exhibiting subsidiaries and all of us at the home office can’t wait to get you back for anhonest-to-God annual meeting,Berkshire-style.February 27, 2021 Warren E.

2BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:Charlie Munger, my long-time partner, and I have the job of managing a portion of your savings. We arehonored by your trust.Our position carries with it the responsibility to report to you what we would like to know if wewere the absentee owner andyouwere the manager. We enjoy communicating directly with you through this annual letter, andthrough the annual meeting as well.Our policy is to treat all shareholders equally. Therefore, we do not hold discussions with analysts nor largeinstitutions. Whenever possible, also, we release important communications on Saturday mornings in order tomaximize the time for shareholders and the media to absorb the news before markets open on Monday.A wealth of Berkshire facts and figures are set forth in the annual 10-K that the company regularly files withthe S.E.C. and that we reproduce on pages K-1 – K-119. Some shareholders will find this detail engrossing; otherswill simply prefer to learn what Charlie and I believe is new or interesting at Berkshire.Alas, there was little action of that sort in 2021. We did, though, make reasonable progress in increasing theintrinsic value of your shares. That task has been my primary duty for 57 years. And it will continue to be.What You OwnBerkshire owns a wide variety of businesses, some in their entirety, some only in part. The second grouplargely consists of marketable common stocks of major American companies. Additionally, we own a few non-U.S.equities and participate in several joint ventures or other collaborative activities.Whatever our form of ownership, our goal is to have meaningful investments in businesseswith both durable economic advantages and a first-class CEO. Please note particularly that we own stocks based upon our expectationsabout their long-termbusinessperformance andnotbecause we view them as vehicles for timely market moves. That point is crucial: Charlie and I arenotstock-pickers; we are business-pickers.I make many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of businesses includes some enterprises thathave truly extraordinary economics, many others that enjoy good economic characteristics, and a few that aremarginal. One advantage of our common-stock segment is that – on occasion – it becomes easy to buy piecesof wonderful businesses at wonderful prices. That shooting-fish-in-a-barrel experience is veryrare in negotiated transactions and never occursen masse. It is also far easier to exit from a mistake when it has been made in the marketable arena.
3Surprise, SurpriseHere are a few items about your company that often surprise even seasoned investors:• Many people perceive Berkshire as a large and somewhat strange collection of financialassets. In truth, Berkshire owns andoperatesmore U.S.-based “infrastructure” assets – classified on our balance sheet asproperty, plant and equipment – than are owned and operated by anyother American corporation. That supremacy has never been our goal. It has, however, become a fact.At yearend, those domestic infrastructure assets were carried on Berkshire’s balance sheet at $158 billion.That number increased last year and will continue to increase. Berkshire alwayswill be building. • Every year, your company makes substantial federal income tax payments. In 2021, for example, we paid$3.3 billion while the U.S. Treasury reported totalcorporate income-tax receipts of $402 billion. Additionally, Berkshire pays substantial state and foreign taxes. “I gave at the office” is an unassailableassertion when made by Berkshire shareholders.Berkshire’s history vividly illustrates the invisible and often unrecognized financial partnership betweengovernment and American businesses. Our tale begins early in 1955, when Berkshire Fine Spinning andHathaway Manufacturing agreed to merge their businesses. In their requests for shareholder approval, thesevenerable New England textile companies expressed high hopes for the combination.The Hathaway solicitation, for example, assured its shareholders that “The combination of the resources andmanagements will result in one of the strongest and most efficient organizations in the textile industry.” Thatupbeat view was endorsed by the company’s advisor, Lehman Brothers (yes, thatLehman Brothers). I’m sure it was a joyous day in both Fall River (Berkshire) and New Bedford (Hathaway) when the unionwas consummated. After the bands stopped playing and the bankers went home, however, the shareholdersreaped a disaster.In the nine years following the merger, Berkshire’s owners watched the company’s net worth crater from$51.4 million to $22.1 million. In part, this decline was caused by stock repurchases, ill-advised dividendsand plant shutdowns. But nine years of effort by many thousands of employees delivered an operating lossas well. Berkshire’s struggles were not unusual: The New England textile industry had silently entered anextended and non-reversible death march.During the nine post-merger years, the U.S. Treasury suffered as well from Berkshire’s troubles. All told, thecompany paid the government only $337,359 in income tax during that period – a pathetic $100 per day. Early in 1965, things changed. Berkshire installed new management that redeployed available cash andsteered essentiallyallearnings into a variety of good businesses, most of which remained good through theyears. Coupling reinvestment of earnings with the power of compounding worked its magic, and shareholdersprospered.Berkshire’s owners, it should be noted, were not the only beneficiary of that course correction. Their “silentpartner,” the U.S. Treasury, proceeded to collect many tens of billionsof dollars from the company in income tax payments. Remember the $100 daily? Now, Berkshire pays roughly $9 milliondaily to the Treasury.
4In fairness to our governmental partner, our shareholders should acknowledge – indeed trumpet – the factthat Berkshire’s prosperity has been fostered mightilybecause the company has operated in America. Our country would have done splendidly in the years since 1965 withoutBerkshire. Absent our American home, however, Berkshire would never have come close to becoming what it is today. When you see the flag, saythanks.• From an $8.6 million purchase of National Indemnity in 1967, Berkshire has become the world leader ininsurance “float” – money we hold and can invest but that does notbelong to us. Including a relatively small sum derived from life insurance, Berkshire’s total float has grown from $19 millionwhen we entered the insurance business to $147billion.So far, this float has cost us less than nothing. Though we have experienced a number of years when insurancelosses combined with operating expenses exceeded premiums, overallwe have earned a modest 55-year profit from the underwriting activities that generated our float.Of equal importance, float is very sticky. Funds attributable to our insurance operations come and go daily,but their aggregate total is immune from precipitous decline. When it comes to investing float, we cantherefore think long-term.If you are not already familiar with the concept of float, I refer you to a long explanation on page A-5. Tomy surprise, our float increased $9 billion last year, a buildup of value that is important to Berkshire ownersthough isnotreflected in our GAAP (“generally-accepted accounting principles”) presentation of earningsand net worth.Much of our huge value creation in insurance is attributable to Berkshire’s good luck in my 1986 hiring ofAjit Jain. We first met on a Saturday morning, and I quickly asked Ajit what his insurance experience hadbeen. He replied, “None.”I said, “Nobody’s perfect,” and hired him. That was my lucky day: Ajit actually wasas perfect a choice as could have been made. Better yet, he continues to be – 35 years later.One final thought about insurance: I believe that it is likely – but farfrom assured – that Berkshire’s float can be maintained without our incurring a long-term underwriting loss. I am certain, however, that there will be some years when we experience such losses, perhaps involving very large sums.Berkshire is constructed to handle catastrophic events as no other insurer – and that priority will remain longafter Charlie and I are gone.Our Four GiantsThrough Berkshire, our shareholders own many dozens of businesses. Some of these, in turn, have acollection of subsidiaries of their own. For example, Marmon has more than 100 individual business operations,ranging from the leasing of railroad cars to the manufacture of medical devices.• Nevertheless, operations of our “Big Four” companies account for a very large chunk of Berkshire’s value.Leading this list is our cluster of insurers. Berkshire effectively owns 100% of this group, whose massivefloat value we earlier described. The invested assets of these insurers are further enlarged by the extraordinaryamount of capital we invest to back up their promises.
5The insurance business is made to order for Berkshire. The product will never be obsolete, and sales volumewill generally increase along with both economic growth and inflation. Also, integrity and capital will foreverbe important. Our company can andwillbehave well. There are, of course, other insurers with excellent business models and prospects. Replication of Berkshire’soperation, however, would be almost impossible.• Apple – our runner-up Giant as measured by its yearend market value – is a different sort of holding. Here,our ownership is a mere 5.55%, up from 5.39% a year earlier. That increase sounds like small potatoes. Butconsider that each0.1%of Apple’s 2021 earnings amounted to $100 million. We spentnoBerkshire funds to gain our accretion. Apple’s repurchases did the job.It’s important to understand that only dividendsfrom Apple are counted in the GAAP earnings Berkshire reports – and last year, Apple paid us $785 million of those. Yet our “share” of Apple’s earnings amountedto a staggering $5.6billion. Much of what the company retained was used to repurchase Apple shares, an actwe applaud. Tim Cook, Apple’s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple products as his firstlove, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim’s managerial touch as well.• BNSF, our third Giant, continues to be the number one artery of American commerce, which makes it anindispensable asset for America as well as for Berkshire. If the many essential products BNSF carries wereinstead hauled by truck, America’s carbon emissions would soar.Your railroad had record earnings of $6 billion in 2021. Here, it should be noted, we are talking about theold-fashioned sort of earnings that we favor: a figure calculated afterinterest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and all forms of compensation. (Our definition suggests a warning: Deceptive “adjustments” toearnings – to use a polite description – have become both more frequent and more fanciful as stocks haverisen. Speaking less politely, I would say that bull markets breed bloviated bull . . ..)BNSF trains traveled 143 million miles last year and carried 535 million tons of cargo. Both accomplishmentsfar exceed those of any other American carrier. You can be proud of your railroad.• BHE, our final Giant, earned a record $4 billion in 2021. That’s up more than 30-fold from the $122 million earned in 2000, the year that Berkshire first purchased a BHE stake. Now, Berkshire owns 91.1% of thecompany.BHE’s record of societal accomplishment is as remarkable as its financial performance. The company hadnowind or solar generation in 2000. It was then regarded simply as a relatively new and minor participant inthe huge electric utility industry. Subsequently, under David Sokol’s and Greg Abel’s leadership, BHE hasbecome a utility powerhouse (no groaning, please) and a leading force in wind, solar and transmissionthroughout much of the United States.Greg’s report on these accomplishments appears on pages A-3 and A-4. The profile you will find there is notin any way one of those currently-fashionable “green-washing” stories. BHE has been faithfully detailing itsplans and performance in renewables and transmissions every year since 2007. To further review this information, visit BHE’s website at brkenergy.com. There, you will see that thecompany haslongbeen making climate-conscious moves that soak up allof its earnings. More opportunities lie ahead. BHE has the management, the experience, the capital and the appetite for the huge power projectsthat our country needs.
6InvestmentsNow let’s talk about companies wedon’tcontrol, a list that again references Apple. Below we list our fifteen largest equity holdings, several of which are selections of Berkshire’s two long-time investment managers, ToddCombs and Ted Weschler. At yearend, this valued pair had totalauthority in respect to $34 billion of investments, many of which do not meet the threshold value we use in the table. Also, a significant portion of the dollars that Toddand Ted manage are lodged in various pension plans of Berkshire-owned businesses, with the assets of these plans not included in this table. 12/31/21Shares

* This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis.** Held by BHE; consequently, Berkshire shareholders have only a 91.1% interest in this position.*** Includes a $10 billion investment in Occidental Petroleum, consisting of preferred stock and warrants tobuy common stock, a combination now being valued at $10.7 billion.In addition to the footnoted Occidental holding and our various common-stock positions, Berkshire also ownsa 26.6% interest in Kraft Heinz (accounted for on the “equity” method, notmarket value, and carried at $13.1 billion) and 38.6% of Pilot Corp., a leader in travel centers that had revenues last year of $45 billion.Since we purchased our Pilot stake in 2017, this holding has warranted “equity” accounting treatment. Earlyin 2023, Berkshire will purchase an additional interest in Pilot that will raise our ownership to 80% and lead to ourfully consolidating Pilot’s earnings, assets and liabilities in our financial statements.
7U.S. Treasury BillsBerkshire’s balance sheet includes $144 billion of cash and cash equivalents (excluding the holdings ofBNSF and BHE). Of this sum, $120 billion is held in U.S. Treasury bills, all maturing in less than a year. That stakeleaves Berkshire financing about
1⁄2of 1% of the publicly-held national debt.Charlie and I have pledged that Berkshire (along with our subsidiaries other than BNSF and BHE) will alwayshold more than $30 billion of cash and equivalents. We want your company to be financially impregnable and never dependent on the kindness of strangers (or even that of friends). Both of us like to sleep soundly, and we want ourcreditors, insurance claimants andyouto do so as well.But $144 billion?That imposing sum, I assure you, is not some deranged expression of patriotism. Nor have Charlie and I lostour overwhelming preference forbusinessownership. Indeed, I first manifested my enthusiasm for that 80 years ago, on March 11, 1942, when I purchased three shares of Cities Services preferred stock. Their cost was $114.75 andrequiredallof my savings. (The Dow Jones Industrial Average that day closed at 99, a fact that should scream to you:Neverbet against America.)After my initial plunge, I always kept at least 80% of my net worth in equities. My favoredstatus throughout that period was 100% – and still is. Berkshire’s current 80%-or-so position in businesses is a consequence of myfailure to find entire companies or small portions thereof (that is, marketable stocks) which meet our criteria for long-term holding.Charlie and I have endured similar cash-heavy positions from time to time in the past. These periods arenever pleasant; they are also never permanent. And, fortunately, we have had a mildly attractive alternative during2020 and 2021 for deploying capital. Read on.Share RepurchasesThere are three ways that we can increase the value of your investment. The first is alwaysfront and center in our minds: Increase the long-term earning power of Berkshire’s controlled businesses through internal growth orby making acquisitions. Today, internal opportunities deliver far better returns than acquisitions. The size of thoseopportunities, however, is small compared to Berkshire’s resources.Our second choice is to buy non-controlling part-interests in the many good or great businesses that arepublicly traded. From time to time, such possibilities are both numerous and blatantly attractive. Today, though, wefind little that excites us.That’s largely because of a truism: Long-term interest rates that are low push the prices of allproductive investments upward, whether these are stocks, apartments, farms, oil wells, whatever. Other factors influencevaluations as well, but interest rates will always be important.Our final path to value creation is to repurchase Berkshire shares. Through that simple act, we increase your share of the many controlledandnon-controlled businesses Berkshire owns. When the price/value equation is right,this path is the easiest and most certain way for us to increase your wealth. (Alongside the accretion of value tocontinuing shareholders, a couple of other parties gain: Repurchases are modestly beneficial to the seller of therepurchased shares and to society as well.)
8Periodically, as alternative paths become unattractive, repurchases make good sense for Berkshire’s owners.During the past two years, we therefore repurchased 9%of the shares that were outstanding at yearend 2019 for a total cost of $51.7 billion. That expenditure left our continuing shareholders owning about 10%more ofallBerkshire businesses, whether these are wholly-owned (such as BNSF and GEICO) or partly-owned (such as Coca-Cola andMoody’s).I want to underscore that for Berkshire repurchases to make sense, our shares mustoffer appropriate value. We don’t want to overpay for the shares of other companies, and it would be value-destroyingif we were to overpay when we are buying Berkshire. As of February 23, 2022, since yearend we repurchased additional shares at a cost of$1.2 billion. Our appetite remains large but will always remain price-dependent.It should be noted that Berkshire’s buyback opportunities are limited becauseof its high-class investor base. If our shares were heavily held by short-term speculators, both price volatility and transaction volumes wouldmaterially increase. That kind of reshaping would offer us far greater opportunities for creating value by makingrepurchases. Nevertheless, Charlie and I far prefer the owners we have, even though their admirable buy-and-keepattitudes limit the extent to which long-term shareholders can profit from opportunistic repurchases.Finally, one easily-overlooked value calculation specific to Berkshire: As we’ve discussed, insurance “float”of the right sort is of great value to us. As it happens, repurchases automatically increase the amount of “float” per share. That figure has increased during the past two years by 25% – going from $79,387 per “A” share to $99,497, ameaningful gain that, as noted, owes some thanks to repurchases.A Wonderful Man and a Wonderful BusinessLast year, Paul Andrews died. Paul was the founder and CEO of TTI, a Fort Worth-based subsidiary ofBerkshire. Throughout his life – in both his business andhis personal pursuits – Paul quietly displayed all the qualities that Charlie and I admire. His story should be told.In 1971, Paul was working as a purchasing agent for General Dynamics when the roof fell in. After losing ahuge defense contract, the company fired thousands of employees, including Paul.With his first child due soon, Paul decided to bet on himself, using $500 of his savings to found Tex-Tronics(later renamed TTI). The company set itself up to distribute small electronic components, and first-year sales totaled$112,000. Today, TTI markets more than one million different items with annual volume of $7.7 billion.But back to 2006: Paul, at 63, then found himself happy with his family, his job, and his associates. But hehad one nagging worry, heightened because he had recently witnessed a friend’s early death and the disastrous resultsthat followed for that man’s family and business. What, Paul asked himself in 2006, would happen to the many peopledepending onhimif he should unexpectedly die?For a year, Paul wrestled with his options. Sell to a competitor? From a strictly economic viewpoint, thatcourse made the most sense. After all, competitors could envision lucrative “synergies” – savings that would beachieved as the acquiror slashed duplicated functions at TTI.B u t...S u c hap u r c haser would most certainly also retain itsCFO,itslegal counsel,itsHR unit. Their TTI counterparts would therefore be sent packing. And ugh! If a new distribution center were to be needed, the acquirer’shome city would certainly be favored over Fort Worth.
9Whatever the financial benefits, Paul quickly concluded that selling to a competitor was not for him. He nextconsidered seeking a financial buyer, a species once labeled – aptly so – a leveraged buyout firm. Paul knew, however,that such a purchaser would be focused on an “exit strategy.” And who could know what that would be? Broodingover it all, Paul found himself having no interest in handing his 35-year-old creation over to a reseller.When Paul met me, he explained why he had eliminated these two alternatives as buyers. He then summedup his dilemma by saying – in far more tactful phrasing than this – “After a year of pondering the alternatives, I wantto sell to Berkshire because you are the only guy left.” So, I made an offer and Paul said “Yes.” One meeting; onelunch; one deal.To say we both lived happily ever after is an understatement. When Berkshire purchased TTI, the companyemployed 2,387. Now the number is 8,043. A large percentage of that growth took place in Fort Worth and environs.Earnings have increased 673%.Annually, I would call Paul and tell him his salary should be substantially increased. Annually, he would tellme, “We can talk about that next year, Warren; I’m too busy now.”When Greg Abel and I attended Paul’s memorial service, we met children, grandchildren, long-timeassociates (including TTI’s first employee) and John Roach, the former CEO of a Fort Worth company Berkshire hadpurchased in 2000. John had steered his friend Paul to Omaha, instinctively knowing we would be a match.At the service, Greg and I heard about the multitudes of people and organizations that Paul had silentlysupported. The breadth of his generosity was extraordinary – geared always to improving the lives of others,particularly those in Fort Worth.In all ways, Paul was a class act. ************ Good luck – occasionallyextraordinaryluck – has played its part at Berkshire. If Paul and I had not enjoyed a mutual friend – John Roach – TTI would not have found its home with us. But that ample serving of luck was onlythe beginning. TTI was soon to lead Berkshire to its most important acquisition.Every fall, Berkshire directors gather for a presentation by a few of our executives. We sometimes choosethe site based upon the location of a recent acquisition, by that means allowing directors to meet the new subsidiary’sCEO and learn more about the acquiree’s activities.In the fall of 2009, we consequently selected Fort Worth so that we could visit TTI. At that time, BNSF,which also had Fort Worth as its hometown, was the third-largest holding among our marketable equities. Despite thatlarge stake, I had never visited the railroad’s headquarters.
Deb Bosanek, my assistant, scheduled our board’s opening dinner for October 22. Meanwhile, I arranged toarrive earlier that day to meet with Matt Rose, CEO of BNSF, whose accomplishments I had long admired. When Imade the date, I had no idea that our get-together would coincide with BNSF’s third-quarter earnings report, whichwas released late on the 22
nd.
The market reacted badly to the railroad’s results. The Great Recession was in full force in the third quarter,and BNSF’s earnings reflected that slump. The economic outlook was also bleak, and Wall Street wasn’t feelingfriendly to railroads – or much else.
10On the following day, I again got together with Matt and suggested that Berkshire would offer the railroad abetter long-term home than it could expect as a public company. I also told him the maximum price that Berkshirewould pay.Matt relayed the offer to his directors and advisors. Eleven busy days later, Berkshire and BNSF announceda firm deal. And here I’ll venture a rare prediction: BNSF will be a key asset for Berkshire andour country a century from now.
The BNSF acquisition would never have happened if Paul Andrews hadn’t sized up Berkshire as the righthome for TTI.
Thanks
I taught my first investing class 70 years ago. Since then, I have enjoyed working almost every year withstudents of all ages, finally “retiring” from that pursuit in 2018.
Along the way, my toughest audience was my grandson’s fifth-grade class. The 11-year-olds were squirmingin their seats and giving me blank stares until I mentioned Coca-Cola and its famous secret formula. Instantly, everyhand went up, and I learned that “secrets” are catnip to kids.Teaching, like writing, has helped me develop and clarify my own thoughts. Charlie calls this phenomenonthe orangutan effect: If you sit down with an orangutan and carefully explain to it one of your cherished ideas, youmay leave behind a puzzled primate, but will yourself exit thinking more clearly.
Talking to university students is far superior. I have urged that they seek employment in (1) the field and (2)with the kind of people they would select, if they had no needfor money. Economic realities, I acknowledge, may interfere with that kind of search. Even so, I urge the students never to give up the quest, for when they find that sortof job, they will no longer be “working.”
Charlie and I, ourselves, followed that liberating course after a few early stumbles. We both started as part-timers at my grandfather’s grocery store, Charlie in 1940 and I in 1942. We were each assigned boring tasks and paidlittle, definitely not what we had in mind. Charlie later took up law, and I tried selling securities. Job satisfactioncontinued to elude us.Finally, at Berkshire, we found what we love to do. With very few exceptions, we have now “worked” formany decades with people whom we like and trust. It’s a joy in life to join with managers such as Paul Andrews orthe Berkshire families I told you about last year. In our home office, we employ decent and talented people – no jerks.Turnover averages, perhaps, one person per year.Iw o u l dl i k e ,h o w e v e r ,t oe m p h a s i z eaf u r t h e ri t e mt h a tt u r n so u rj o b si n t of u na n ds a t i s f a c t i o n----w o r k i n gfor you. There is nothing more rewarding to Charlie and me than enjoying the trust of individuallong-term shareholders who, for many decades, have joined us with the expectation that we would be a reliable custodian of theirfunds.Obviously, we can’t select our owners, as we could do if our formof operation were a partnership. Anyone can buy shares of Berkshire today with the intention of soon reselling them. For sure, we get a few of that type ofshareholder, just as we get index funds that own huge amounts of Berkshire simply because they are required to doso.
11To a truly unusual degree, however, Berkshire has as owners a very large corps of individuals and familiesthat have elected to join us with an intent approaching “til death do us part.” Often, they have trusted us with a large– some might sayexcessive– portion of their savings.Berkshire, these shareholders would sometimes acknowledge, might be far from the bestselection they could have made. But they would add that Berkshire would rank high among those with which they would be mostcomfortable. And people who are comfortable with their investments will, on average, achieve better results than thosewho are motivated by ever-changing headlines, chatter and promises.
Long-term individual owners are both the “partners” Charlie and I have always sought and the ones weconstantly have in mind as we make decisions at Berkshire. To them we say, “It feels good to ‘work’ for you, and youhave our thanks for your trust.”
